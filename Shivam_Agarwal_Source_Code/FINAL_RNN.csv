46 School can be very bad for you.,CLAIM
71 I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child.,CLAIM
4651 If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years do.,CLAIM
4943 I'm not either pro-homeschool or pro-public school. I have seen it from all angles and am now seeing it from the parent's angle. That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year. This year it may be homeschool. Next year it may be public school. My child changes every year and so will his needs.,CLAIM
58 Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school.,CLAIM
87 No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE.,CLAIM

42 There should NOT be any praying in school.,CLAIM
13 Pray at home.,CLAIM
462 Get it out of public schools,CLAIM
1487 Why don't students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them (e.g. Muslims go to Muslim schools Christians to Christian schools Jewish to Jewish schools etc.),CLAIM
93 I think that religion should be either implemented for ALL religions; or otherwise for none.,CLAIM
31 NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS!...period.,CLAIM
104 No religious activities in schools.,CLAIM
104 There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion's prayer services.,CLAIM
75 As a student i think schools should definately support prayer in schools .,CLAIM
597 As far as prayer in school I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate.,CLAIM
558 Saying a student or a teacher can't pray is a OBVIOUS VIOLATION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM!,CLAIM
364 ok so i think giving five minutes up a day during school as prayer time where everyone prays in there heads i think would be ok.,CLAIM
101 If a student wishes to silently pray during my class I do not have a problem with it.,CLAIM
323 I also don't think teachers/administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable.,CLAIM
382 However voluntary non-disruptive,CLAIM
2163 But not everyone is thrilled about the inclusion of prayer in school.,CLAIM
987 While I am a Christian and I follow Jesus I don’t believe that bringing ‘prayer back into the schools’ will do anything of value to our school system,CLAIM
95 I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools.,CLAIM

385 i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools.,CLAIM
468 It just isn’t fair to have prayer required in schools.,CLAIM

492 Let me say as a parent and as a Christian I don't want my daughter's teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school — including what someone else might consider good Christian prayer or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation.,CLAIM
2312 But more important than that imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong.,CLAIM
2738 It's time to disestablish the Church in this country as well and allow children to pick any religion (or none) in their own time,CLAIM
2618 Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want; no one’s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard. But the state (including the public schools) cannot mandate sponsor conduct,CLAIM
122 Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official (who is a gov't official if we are talking about public schools).,CLAIM

137 Cut down on the (misogynistic) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won't be any perceived need for single-gender classrooms.,CLAIM
447 Let’s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school.,CLAIM
799 Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include:,CLAIM
1775 Leonard Sax a psychologist and physician argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal,CLAIM
2207 According to the ACLU not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective they are illegal.,CLAIM
207 I wouldn't be sending my children to a single sex school.,CLAIM
24 Personally i'd go co-ed.,CLAIM
946 If your daughter is on the fence about it i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities teachers,CLAIM
378 However if you want an opinon from a general education pespective and you can read up on this,CLAIM
1364 Nevertheless all things being equal I think it is generally accepted amongst educators that single-sex schools at high school level is better for learning outcomes than co-ed schools.,CLAIM
108 Can't say I particularly liked it I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed.,CLAIM
137 I still think co-ed is more natural though.,CLAIM
434 I highly recommend a co-ed school.,CLAIM
337 Ideally I don’t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age let alone sex.,CLAIM
37 I regard single sex education as bad.,CLAIM
249 I don't think that home schooling is good for children and I don't think that single sex schooling is good for children either.,CLAIM
634 Had I a daughter I would encourage her to find single-sex schools.,CLAIM
62 Single sex education has been very good for girls especially.,CLAIM
287 I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools,CLAIM
342 If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation.,CLAIM
559 In 2013 is single-sex education really the way to go? My view on the subject is no.,CLAIM
324 I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn't trade for the world.,CLAIM
142 The public school was a joke.,CLAIM
189 While I'm all for public schools; both our kids attend.,CLAIM
507 More to the point US public schools are the best in the world.,CLAIM
835 I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities: I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad.,CLAIM
424 If there had been anyway possible that I could have sent them to private school. You betcha I would have. I think private schools are great and hope a lot more come about.,CLAIM
932 What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something.,CLAIM
317 TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID,CLAIM
85 Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them.,CLAIM
117 Run don't walk to the nearest private school.,CLAIM
78 The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore.,CLAIM
1522 I'm proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon!,CLAIM
203 Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!,CLAIM
275 The public school system the way it is now is not an option.,CLAIM
469 Nope public school not for me!,CLAIM
152 The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly.,CLAIM
649 paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best (private school).,CLAIM

431 I encourage everybody I know to send their children to private school.,CLAIM
1935 I have a three year old and if I have to take a second or third job she will be going to a private school.,CLAIM
92 There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse.,CLAIM
187 There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school and guess what they are none of your business but here are a few.,CLAIM
539 Ergo if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district you're damn right I'm going to put them in a private school if I'm able to do it.,CLAIM
295 I am all for Private Schools.  I will never let my kids go to public school,CLAIM
416 PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SUCKS,CLAIM
289 No more will she ever go to a public school again.,CLAIM
735 Public school is what you and your parents make of it.,CLAIM
561 The best education is the only route to go; and it isn't in a public school system.,CLAIM
208 If you want you children to get a good education private is the only way to do it!,CLAIM
99 I don't know about the rest of Virginia but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools.,CLAIM
1003 I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling.,CLAIM
724 I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving.,CLAIM
792 Teach them yourself or take a lone and send them to private school but get your kids out of “Free” public education if you want them to ever succeed.,CLAIM
497 If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation.,CLAIM
65 Parents have the right to send their children to private schools.,CLAIM
85 we choose to send our children to a Catholic school,CLAIM
595 i live in an area (Georgia) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here.,CLAIM
903 If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it.,CLAIM
427 I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools.,CLAIM
79 There's no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today's times.,CLAIM
1487 There's nothing wrong with private schools.,CLAIM
2007 But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children.,CLAIM
567 Then I did the research and found for the most part that they are doing a fine job and I said so.,CLAIM
65 I try not to be anti-homeschooling but... it's just hard for me.,CLAIM
261 I think it is a very loving thing a good and decent thing to send children to a private school!,CLAIM
298 public education is for the most part terrible,CLAIM
162 Private school wins no matter where you go.,CLAIM
957 if the school starts to suck then guess what I'll send her to private school,CLAIM
111 My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8. Best decision they ever made.,CLAIM
1891 I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school.,CLAIM
324 Australians are not mistaken - unfortunately the private system is miles ahead.,CLAIM
958 as a community private education is far better around than state education can be,CLAIM
138 Home schooling should be illegal,CLAIM
635 I don't see any need for home schooling any child,CLAIM
473 Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them!,CLAIM
106 I'm on the homeschool side of the debate.,CLAIM
188 I know there are some advantages at private schools having gone to a woefully basic selective high school.,CLAIM
65 You are a bad person if you send your children to private school.,CLAIM
109 It doesn’t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools.,CLAIM
45 If you can I would suggest Private schooling.,CLAIM
117 Public school are just as good really if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable,CLAIM
67 I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool.,CLAIM
315 model c or private school is your best bet!,CLAIM
268 Granted public education like most other government programs,CLAIM
471 Honestly if you can afford to put your child in a private school by all means do so,CLAIM
483 However inclusion in our education system is not automatically in the best interest of every child.,CLAIM
334 Even in the story in the original post I think mainstreaming was a good thing.,CLAIM
262 this works awesome!!,CLAIM
1086 From my point of view mainstreaming is not a terrible idea but it is lamentable in its execution,CLAIM
54 I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids.,CLAIM
802 I don't think it worksunless all classes are small (15 max) and all children with needs have one to one help.,CLAIM
1196 I feel quite strongly that these students deserve education and mixing with others but mainstream is not the way.,CLAIM
314 For the majority of the children in the school mainstream would not have been a suitable placement.,CLAIM
832 In some cases inclusion can work fantastically well.,CLAIM
1819 So the question is… should a child who has such significant learning difficulties be in a mainstream classroom? If the child has support throughout all of his schooling life I see why not.,CLAIM
499 I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful.,CLAIM
2328 It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward.,CLAIM
1178 Anyway I guess it's a individual decision but I think to do it for any reason but survival is a bit shallow and probably useless.,CLAIM
83 Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines,CLAIM
397 But this holding them back because they are immature? No way - not a good reason IMO ...,CLAIM
119 I don't see the big deal.,CLAIM
692 I'm happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision.,CLAIM
305 It indicates that those born June-Dec. should be held back from kindergarten a year.,CLAIM
463 The school was reluctant to retain her and told us this was rarely done but we know this was the best decision we ever could have made.,CLAIM
112 It's not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it's better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled.,CLAIM
268 Three of my girls were born in August but there is no question of holding them back.,CLAIM
438 With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he’s six.,CLAIM
51 I think you should “redshirt” your son no offense.,CLAIM
1496 They just aren't working right now and I will not allow my child to suffer waiting for the entire system to be repaired.,CLAIM
739 I do not support home schooling.,CLAIM
357 Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with.,CLAIM
561 I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school but I do know that home education works for us.,CLAIM
59 I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters.,CLAIM
203 I wouldn't trust a state school to train a dog much less raise a child.,CLAIM
109 Lesson plans (and the national curriculum) are the death of real education.,PREMISE
2396 Research by ourselves at the University of London's Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met. Home education can range from the highly structured based on set curriculums and lessons,PREMISE
2728 Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best.,PREMISE
387 We teach our children how to learn not merely how to pass tests.,PREMISE
1205 Also consider that school is about 25% efficient so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time you lose a fair bit in disruptions,PREMISE
128 For some people it can be a catastophic experience from which they never recover.,PREMISE
679 If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas. Early formal education adult-led activities single age classes,PREMISE
1322 Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate. They can use tutors courses other home educating parents,PREMISE
1502 Home educators come from many backgrounds with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured adult-led to the informal,PREMISE
1744 Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education or because they favour education methods not available in state schools. Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child.,PREMISE
158 My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging.,PREMISE
979 I wasn’t me that ‘couldn’t be bothered to learn’ it was the teachers who couldn’t be bothered to teach.,PREMISE
1120 To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick!,PREMISE
649 Kids do better academically when homeschooled.,PREMISE
1098 Homeschooled children significantly outperform children educated in public school systems in reading language math,PREMISE
1259 Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills.,PREMISE
1805 Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child’s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world.,PREMISE
2174 It’s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest.,PREMISE
2281 It’s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own.,PREMISE
2394 It’s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature speed and context of their broader socialization.,PREMISE
2553 We live in a day of under-protective parenting. Our culture has declared war on children in so many ways. Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back.,PREMISE
4706 Not just for the academics but for their protection.,PREMISE
1954 Today's homeschoolers can learn Russian or even geometry without their parent's assistance through DVDs and online courses.,PREMISE
2280 Today parents and students can choose a variety of ways to homeschool. There are co-ops that offer classes to all levels from pre-k to high school.,PREMISE
3049 The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules.,PREMISE
611 Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying violence drugs,PREMISE
2439 Public schools argue that their kids are better socialized. In reality children and teens are locked behind gates on campus are segregated by age,PREMISE
2918 In contrast a homeschooler’s “classroom” is the world around him/her. Parents don’t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room. They hold lessons in parks libraries or museums. They take weekly field trips to places of interest in the community,PREMISE
3704 In contrast homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity developing a sense of responsibility,PREMISE
4227 Lastly it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior including drug abuse,PREMISE
1152 Your only child will have the educational freedom to choose what he wants to learn and in a pace that he finds comfortable. You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities.,PREMISE
3009 Bullying peer pressure teasing,PREMISE
3374 Many parents of single children do worry about the adverse affect of wrong peer group at school on their child. Confidence self-esteem pride,PREMISE
3823 In many families spiritual and religious beliefs are integral to their daily lives. Homeschooling is an option for those families who wish to nurture in their children their spiritual beliefs.,PREMISE
114 The whole point is to separate education from religion.,PREMISE
212 If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school.,PREMISE
649 And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property.,PREMISE
108 Way too many people to cater to.,PREMISE
665 We've heard about public school space being allotted to accommodate one religion and its demand for a dedicated space. Muslim prayer is strictly segregated. Gender segregation violates our Charter of Rights and Freedoms whichunder Section 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race; national or ethnic origin; colour; religion; gender; age; and mental or physical disability. Sexual orientation has recently been recognized as a prohibited ground for discrimination under the Charter.,PREMISE
92 They do not belong. Pray on your own time.,PREMISE
664 Our society just isn't gear for that. Ultimately we as a society lose.,PREMISE
423 They do not impose significantly on the other traditions.,PREMISE
125 Praying is a home thing or a church temple,PREMISE
164 Prayer is not for public consumption.,PREMISE
313 Canada is a secular nation.,PREMISE
44 School is a place of learning.,PREMISE
218 This political correctness is making people less tolerant creating hard feelings and driving an even bigger wedge between people..,PREMISE
343 Thousands of different religions in this world but everyone seems to think that their religion is the only one that counts...,PREMISE
1024 I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian because it makes students of other faiths' uncomfortable yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed.,PREMISE
168 But to just bring in services for one group flies in the face of equality.,PREMISE
137 Our education system (as with our government) must remain secular and free from these silly distractions.,PREMISE
68 The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none.,PREMISE
481 Constitutionally Canada has no religion although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground.,PREMISE
582 Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable.,PREMISE
104 If we allow Christian students to pray you must allow Wiccan students to pray Jewish,PREMISE
277 Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home by parents.,PREMISE
137 A school is a public institution. It might offend some people.,PREMISE
503 A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words so why make a big deal of it?.,PREMISE
78 The bible says to pray in private. It also says to not use God's name in vain.,PREMISE
472 Well duh it is this simple: Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do,PREMISE
431 If their students did get an interview which was rare they didn't have the social skills to survive the first round.,PREMISE
799 I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families. All four have no intention of book-schooling their daughters past age 13 as they need to learn :homemaking skills. One of the girls who has not been taught for two years could be Josh Powell's twin. She is intelligent and desperate to learn,PREMISE
112 first praying is not asking good for things like i want a bike i dont want braces its asking god for forgivness.,PREMISE
235 and second catholics dont spend there whole weekend in a church praying its only one hour. one hour out of 48 is not alot.,PREMISE
218 However when they want to pray out loud or with a group I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable.,PREMISE
822 The majority of home schooled children I have met and had contact with are smart and get along well with adults,PREMISE
2003 But if prayer really works then that group of students calling out to God around the flagpole becomes a threat to those who deny the God’s existence or His sovereignty over this world.,PREMISE
2143 If prayer really works then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview.,PREMISE
2242 If prayer really works then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness.,PREMISE
1417 “I ask the teachers to say a prayer at each assembly” says Principal Cooper. “It shows the students that we understand they are spiritual beings. And it’s a reminder that they can apply the principles of their faith – like hard work and honesty – to school.”,PREMISE
445 When we came together as a country we had a religiously diverse population so when we wrote the constitution,PREMISE
641 Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers because how could,PREMISE
1389 It would only be fair that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer Muslim prayer and yes,PREMISE
2281 It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner. It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back if that’s what we want we should send our kids to a Christian school.,PREMISE
2705 Forced prayer isn’t prayer anyway.,PREMISE
683 Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard. It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time.,PREMISE
789 Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth.,PREMISE
1772 Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God's existence. Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists. Once acknowledgement of God's existence is removed there is no absolute basis for morals and a free society drifts toward anarchy.,PREMISE
2439 What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms.,PREMISE
2847 Allowing prayer in schools will improve not detract from a student's understanding of the universe.,PREMISE
2959 Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God's existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure.,PREMISE
1043 America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children’s prayer touched upon: youth family education,PREMISE
1326 The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “not to take the name of the Lord in vain.”,PREMISE
137 I too believed that out nation is under a great fall due taking prayer out of schools and attempting to take God out of everything we do.,PREMISE
256 Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants.,PREMISE
177 It is just another sign of moral/spiritual decay of the American.,PREMISE
217 Japan where no one prays at school has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation.,PREMISE
270 Even Jesus was against school prayer.,PREMISE
198 to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief trust and fear of God because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it.,PREMISE
6141 If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I’m sorry is not to learn about religion.,PREMISE
316 only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man. He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes.,PREMISE
434 to eliminate all the violence.,PREMISE
279 The fact is that as long as we were a praying nation in school and in government we were truly a blessed nation. Since that was removed almost 50 years ago we have been spiralling out of control.,PREMISE
1204 Yet in times of great tragedy school leaders inevitably seek guidance and solace from the same God they’ve expelled.,PREMISE
1315 I’ve often wondered – if God is good enough for the bad times shouldn’t He be good enough for the good times?,PREMISE
223 It's ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer.,PREMISE
570 That's why we go to church on Sundays not the local middle school cafeteria.,PREMISE
2055 As Britain becomes more secular it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books.,PREMISE
2552 The United States a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls has enshrined that idea in its constitution: the state must not support or endorse any religion,PREMISE
1227 In fact the Bill of Rights’ First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech (prayer can obviously be a form of speech) as well as the right to free exercise of religion (praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one’s religion). So the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned,PREMISE
2132 The state may not establish endorse promote,PREMISE
5384 Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring.,PREMISE
79 1) There's no reason to suspect it matters. It is wasting valuable school time.,PREMISE
288 2) The 1st amendment clearly establishes (heh heh get it) that the government may not sponsor a religion. There are many religions that do not pray to their gods and some that don't have any gods whatsoever.,PREMISE
453 3) Not only thatbut the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general. Prayer is solely religious in nature.,PREMISE
518 4) It forces children to think that religion is okay. It's not.,PREMISE
629 5) Religion is a touchy issue. There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been.,PREMISE
801 6) Children are impressionable. Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not.,PREMISE
887 7) Dowant a fiery southern baptist leading your child in say non-Catholic prayers?,PREMISE

1342 Teaching things that contradicting any belief or lack of belief is one thing. Teaching God and then praying to that deity is something else,PREMISE
1665 I have only one more problem. Where would we find enough time for an actual school day?,PREMISE
135 Yes that's true but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts,PREMISE
595 I don't think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it's current decrepit state.,PREMISE
821 There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone.,PREMISE

112 they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do...,PREMISE
1636 The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill. Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other feeling comfortable going to parties and just appreciating from a boy’s view that girls are not some ‘alien creature’ not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole.,PREMISE
2355 My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension. If the atmosphere in the school is right if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant exciting,PREMISE
226 —The boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together,PREMISE
498 many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about being bad readers and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment. the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact.,PREMISE
379 Seriously our society depends on us interacting with each at the very least,PREMISE
218 If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent creative individuals without the boy craziness (and reducing of one's self to something befitting a boy's attention),PREMISE
1423 Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students especially at certain ages. Leonard Sax founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education,PREMISE
1708 Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes. While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes girls and boys can be free to pursue math science,PREMISE
2156 Still critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience laughable to neuroscientists. The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students.,PREMISE
3000 Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue. For example consider the theories that boys are visual learners and girls are auditory learners. Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter. It is the quality of teachers' training lessons,PREMISE
144 It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls.,PREMISE
1433 His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more “positive school behavior” to model. “In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often. Boys take a more laid-back approach work less hard,PREMISE
1972 In another study conducted by Salomone (2006) she states “There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents….girls report that they feel more comfortable…interact more with teachers…and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects (math and science).” Salomone also states that single-sex schooling for promotes interest for boys in humanities courses and that boys’ feel more at ease because they do not feel societal pressures to be male.,PREMISE
2516 Howeverit should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations. As mentioned in a study by Mael (1998) coeducation classrooms and schools reflect real life and prepare youths for gender interactions and society more so than a single-sex school would it could also reduce sex stereotypes. Also,PREMISE
2806 Further in the study Mael highlights both the benefits for females and males to single-sex education he states that because coeducational schools foster obsession over hair and clothes and tend to make girls more silent that the single-sex education of girls is better for their mentality.,PREMISE
733 Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships. They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school.,PREMISE
1137 children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex despite not being able to interact every day. Some children depending on disposition,PREMISE
2050 He argues that the language of “separate but equal” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students’ access single-sex education is about broadening students’ access and opportunities.,PREMISE
2581 Title IX which states that “No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex,PREMISE
3100 Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum. As a result they were in fact decidedly unequal.,PREMISE
107 Social education is important alongside academics. The real world is not segregated nor are universities.,PREMISE
282 I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex.,PREMISE
532 There's no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for. So both kept one another in line and made for a more positive and dynamic environment.,PREMISE
820 I also think there's a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools. Dating relationships interacting with the opposite sex,PREMISE
480 Same sex education works best for males. Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools. Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around and they're less inclined to show off and seek attention. Boys are also able to focus better during their puberity stages without the distraction of girls and the urges their hormones tend to trigger.,PREMISE
1038 The life lessons learned from interacting with the opposite sex would be the winner for me.,PREMISE
511 For a variety of reasons boys in a classroom has an overall negative impact on girls' learning.,PREMISE
231 Sometimes single sex schools don't have the numbers (or enough interest) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes boys schools may not run home-ec classes.,PREMISE
398 Also if girls schools don't have the interest/enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject.,PREMISE
366 Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry. Any decent school will have various other contacts.,PREMISE
929 Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are IN GENERAL better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools.,PREMISE
962 I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions; at the end of 6 years you come out with a study score but once you have that,PREMISE
298 It is closer to the 'real world' that way. Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes... They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense.,PREMISE
95 Studies have shown girls perform better (academically) in all-girls high schools than in co-ed.,PREMISE
279 Interestingly the boys I know from single sex schools seem more against it than the girls and they do feel they were socially hampered a bit.,PREMISE
588 But I feel that the co-ed school is more natural and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school .,PREMISE
1176 and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis.,PREMISE
1663 Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of: I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools. What I mean by this is girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school (inside and outside of school) yes,PREMISE
1960 Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school (maybe their brother school) guys from the train station the arcade . . . you get my drift. They tend to be more open to hanging out with guys they've just met – and not really knowing anything about them.,PREMISE
215 There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down.,PREMISE
363 Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking.,PREMISE
221 In a rough analogy to monocultural farming I think than any highly homogeneous group of people while it offers certain efficiencies,PREMISE
561 In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals. They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people. In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women. This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment.,PREMISE
690 A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned.,PREMISE
490 Women spoke. Assertively. Being intellectual and smart was cool. Speaking up was cool. When I went to law school and later to grad school I could always pick out the women who attended women's colleges. We all could.,PREMISE
185 Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions.,PREMISE
326 to cut down on the distraction factor.,PREMISE
428 But that still would not mean that society would benefit from children being spoon-fed in homogeneous groups when the real world is diverse and demands adaptation.,PREMISE
826 To everyone who thinks girls are better off in single-sex schools so that they don't invest time in being sexually desirable to men I would note that we might be better off working toward a society where girls don't see themselves as sex objects rather than designing institutions that say,PREMISE
1517 We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions.,PREMISE
267 Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt.Most Kids are distracteddo a lot of sextingindulge/experiment in sexual acts,PREMISE
608 Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school.some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools.,PREMISE
241 Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction.,PREMISE
1090 Once I switched schools I found myself with valuable – and what I’m sure to be life long – friendships with the boys I sat with in class.,PREMISE
1416 Well smart child smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school!,PREMISE
1523 I really felt if I had stayed I would have been unprepared for life after high school socially speaking.,PREMISE
2087 Having spent middle school – those really developmental years around very few boys – talking to them became a major cause of stress. I clammed up and couldn’t put a sentence together. I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby shy and rude – simply because I hadn’t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex,PREMISE
2432 The cattiness hierarchy and estrogen rages became a whole other issue. The cliques and gossip were unbearable.,PREMISE
3629 Just because we had a strict uniform by no means did that mean there wasn’t competition wardrobe-wise. Who makes your sneakers? Purse? Jewelry? Which uniform style are YOU wearing? Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan’s Candy Bar tote then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom. EVERYONE had the same one! All-estrogen environments at that age thrive on gossip and making oneself seem holier-than-thou to at least a few girls.,PREMISE
879 Based on my experience and my research on competition gender,PREMISE
2927 A 2009 study by professors at UCLA's Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls' schools show stronger academic orientations especially in math and computer skills and higher standardized tests scores,PREMISE
2836 Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that “there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students’ academic performance but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism.” As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes these schools don’t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes,PREMISE
1332 Many sociologists agree that females areunable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias,PREMISE
3521 Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men.,PREMISE
2692 The evidence wasn’t very good then for a gap between the genders’ learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction and it hasn’t gotten any better.,PREMISE
3042 Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small that there is a great deal of variability among individuals,PREMISE
6065 For a critical mass families and kids some period of single-sex education is part of a path toward an adulthood informed in positive ways by an understanding of both the differences between the sexes and the ways in which we are all bound by our shared and very human anxieties aspirations,PREMISE
112 The essential difference were the students. And it makes all the difference.,PREMISE
244 The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria.  They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies.,PREMISE
1301 They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability income behavior,PREMISE
1635 With private schools stealing students away from public schools the problem is exacerbated further.  Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite.,PREMISE
2098 In light of that factthere are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools: 1) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitismor 2) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are better than their public counterparts.,PREMISE
128 There is no more public education it is all indoctrination warm and fuzzy political correctness.,PREMISE
146 It isn’t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching.,PREMISE
1986 No everybody can teach and learn at home and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “As” as possible on their resu,PREMISE
515 I feel the private schools up the expectations and standards for the public school system.,PREMISE
938 And the public school doesn't provide anything for those kids but the system still takes their money.,PREMISE
693 Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also.,PREMISE
213 what about all the money we do send to our schools .does it help our child. no .teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike .,PREMISE
430 The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way.  Private teachers have more passion about teaching  because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole.,PREMISE
557 Children in the public school systems ARE left behind bullied and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities.,PREMISE
193 Public schools are not about education; they are about social engineering.,PREMISE
989 Public schools are fad driven.  Remember new math?  Of course not.  No one does.  Cooperative education?  Social advancement?  Mainstreaming?,PREMISE
1451 Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose.,PREMISE
136 I then send my children to a private school to instill moral behavior and God in their lives.,PREMISE
293 I have a responsibility to my Child to do the best I can for her and sending her to the public school system to be endoctronated into the moral standards( or lack there of ) that the Government standards dictate is NOT what is best for her.,PREMISE
224 I am a single mother and I make less than most people and I am sending my child to a private school.,PREMISE
499 Also the private schools don't teach all of this anti American social justice crap. Private schools don't promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles.,PREMISE
405 One major reason - God is not allowed in the public schools but He is more than welcomed in the private!,PREMISE
295 Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood it is clear that our district schools have issues...financially and educationally.,PREMISE
1403 Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight like quality education not quantity education,PREMISE
77 Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues.,PREMISE
413 Yes out public school system is broken but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools' job,PREMISE
951 So yes if you want a strong no bull,PREMISE
1294 As the morality of our society crashes so too,PREMISE
137 The problem is that Democrat/socialists run most public schools and continue that in higher education which is also failing our children.,PREMISE
470 We keep hearing that public school is where your kids get their social skills to go into the real world. You are sure as hell right about that today; how to roll a joint how to talk on the phone; how to take it in the a$$!,PREMISE
260 Our liberal anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching.,PREMISE
577 Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society. They instead use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles.,PREMISE
691 When my kids got old enough for school I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work.  My kids both have nice professional jobs.,PREMISE
214 I believe in discipline accountability and excellence.  These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything.,PREMISE
436 Plus I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution.,PREMISE
215 The unions are their main priorty not the child's education.,PREMISE
420 As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class. The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system...not to parents.,PREMISE
517 This is where money talks if you want to make a change or have a say in your child's education,PREMISE
430 I was a product of the public school system and yes they are very necessary.,PREMISE
288 I am a loving knowledgeable intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life.,PREMISE
1172 Public schools will never get better until they have competition.  It is time we stop rewarding a bad system and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition.,PREMISE
537 Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools.,PREMISE
834 Schools are not always bad because of funding etc.  Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers.,PREMISE
296 The public school system lets them deal with real life too unfortunate that it may be but that is what's out there in college and the work force too.,PREMISE
375 There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them.,PREMISE
139 remember keeping your kids away from knowledge that you don't like is a moral crime.,PREMISE
627 Yes I took my son out of public school because I felt that the (lack of) education he was receiving was not up to standard. He was in 5th grade and his spelling words were the days of the weekand one of four native English speaker in his class.,PREMISE
1257 The teachers from my experience expect the students to teach themselves they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends(other staff),PREMISE
1651 One more thing at least a private school can FIRE a teacher for legitimate reasons ( molesting kids etc) unlike public schools who's teachers unions have PROTECTED those who have committed crimes against our children(ex. teacher feeding his semen to children on cookies).,PREMISE
292 Being an involved parent with kids in public schools it doesn't matter what policies I try to bring about or suggestions I bring,PREMISE
259 But religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a kid devoid of a proper education. It's the same as denying a sick child medicine because it offends the parents religious beliefs.,PREMISE
128 Most public schools especially those that are intercity are not good.,PREMISE
436 We put all of our effort into making the system better joined every group volunteered at the school and all events.  Reality sunk in.  Very little changed with all our efforts. Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish.,PREMISE
672 I lost all faith in our local public educators when I was repeatedly asked You're an engineer like on a train? and How do I hook this to the computer? (speaking about the cardboard pinhole camera we had made that day with the class with film),PREMISE
303 When I heard my daughter (in 8th grade at a public school) who has to work very hard to get slightly above avg. grades say the kids are such a distraction in the classroom and I can't concentrate/work.  And the teachers can't do anything about it.,PREMISE
450 That was all it took for me to send her to the private school where the learning environment is better and the teachers can do something about it.,PREMISE
364 in a public school the teacher's hands are tied by politically correct nonsense.  They cannot correct errors cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students assign homework,PREMISE
285 That's right I do not give a s**t about the public schools system I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school.,PREMISE
227 Consciously depriving a child of an adequate education solely because father knows best or thinks he does is tantamount to child abuse.,PREMISE
492 When it comes to medical care the courts often overrule parents who are irrationally threatening a child's life due to mistaken religious beliefs. If a teenager told doctors I want this treatment and the parents refused to give consent,PREMISE
554 An adequate education is vitally important in a child's life.,PREMISE
321 Some teachers need to be fired some retired and some need to change vocations. Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now retirement safe this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood.,PREMISE
469 Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school.,PREMISE
359 The kids there are very respectful and so far no one asked about my gun.   If I go into a public school they ask about your gun and half the time while we are there we are arresting someone.,PREMISE
257 I rose up to make changes...rose up to my feet and walked my family the hell out of a corrupt unsafe government battle ground and into the Private Catholic school system.,PREMISE
377 It wasn't that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn't help it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers whoeven obvious to a 7th grader,PREMISE
720 Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education they teach evolution they teach homosexuality generally at an early age,PREMISE
277 You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential.,PREMISE
133 People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education.,PREMISE
515 Lack of discipline turning teachers into babysitters banning prayer and the Ten Commandments,PREMISE
392 Public schools are not influenced by parents that's hooey. Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments. Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum what happens in the classroom,PREMISE
780 How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed.,PREMISE
107 People who send their children to a private school are not “bad” people. They want the best for their kids!,PREMISE
288 The children in the private system are polite listen to what you are telling them and responsive.,PREMISE
541 The children in the public system some not all,PREMISE
1270 The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children. They have to keep the numbers up to keep the funds rolling in.,PREMISE
1394 The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent’s sign that the children can be disciplined.,PREMISE
299 By helping pay for it but not sending their children there they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student.,PREMISE
290 They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence.  Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence.,PREMISE
209 Private schools get students ready for collage and they are given lots of attention.,PREMISE
263 People generally do this because they want what is best for their children.,PREMISE
409 For example religion is a good thing...the public school does not believe in that.....Christmas is usually referred to as the 'Winter Festival.',PREMISE
640 Additionally I don't want my child indoctrinated with leftist liberal crap. The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child's education.,PREMISE
141 He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character!,PREMISE
342 I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures. In public school the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions!,PREMISE
306 Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor.  I am involved as a parent why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system.,PREMISE
504 The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more.  They could do this at public schools but do not.,PREMISE
341 unless the teachers can prove they can teach.,PREMISE
174 No matter how well intentioned few parents have the education time,PREMISE
516 I'm not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she's not Mexican. Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn't speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something.,PREMISE
667 Not having it......    So you can judge and tell me I'm wrong but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools.,PREMISE
538 Public schools want a monopoly. For years they nearly had one the result the sad shape of our public school system. Unions DO NOT like competition (try walking across a strike line,PREMISE
328 We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people.  They have a 100% college acceptance rate!  That's unheard of in public schools.,PREMISE
297 I'm dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university. What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence..,PREMISE
182 The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked first.,PREMISE
174 Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral.,PREMISE
341 It is a totally deteriorated system it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place.,PREMISE
582 Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment.,PREMISE
409 Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies.,PREMISE
121 Public school has shortened hours and the school year in Orange County CA.,PREMISE
124 There is no education in public schools any more! The government teachers unions and political correctness has killed them.,PREMISE
799 Once they start working or going to college they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in,PREMISE
507 Most public schools cannot handle really bright kids.  This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time.  Why?  They have to teach to the test so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given.  Kids that are really bright quick learners,PREMISE
727 Many of these kids then go on to underachieve in middle and high school because their initial experiences left them bored and as a result often totally disinterested in school.,PREMISE
1441 All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash or takes all night because they are so bored they can't stand it.,PREMISE
499 Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ WRITE SPELL,PREMISE
936 So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country.,PREMISE
196 The advantage of private school is simple my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children a top notch education.,PREMISE
397 The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch.,PREMISE
188 When the school is crappy because administration cares more about the money going into their pockets and less about the kids actually getting an education there isn't much parents can do.,PREMISE
343 In addition I don't like the liberal slant to everthing that is taught in public school.,PREMISE
436 We pay very high taxes most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions  not how they derive at them.  As such there is pressure on the schools  to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place.,PREMISE
849 My personal experience with the public schools in many districts is that they teach to the lowest common denominator. The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class. In the private school system the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student even if that mean expelling them from the school.,PREMISE
945 What are parents to do when Unions refuse to correct or fire ineffective school teachers because they have tenure and are protected by unions.,PREMISE
1162 What are parents to do when school boards respond for the calls for reform with the formation of yet another useless committee that will investigate the matter and make recommendations that are never put into effect.,PREMISE
426 Private schools = better education? Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families.,PREMISE
999 Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged.  That is what is wrong. They have a Gay Straight Alliance club but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as intolerant which is complete BS.,PREMISE
1129 All of this is avoided at most private schools.,PREMISE
263 The only reason the government cares about public education at all is the control and the potential revenue.,PREMISE
514 What more proof “free” public education has failed the highest test scores across the nation come from Home school kids.   They are courted by the top colleges and prove their worth time and time again.  Why?  Concerned active parental involvement.,PREMISE
86 I just pulled my child out of public school because of the incompetent teachers there.,PREMISE
591 Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices.,PREMISE
840 In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas and she is actually graded and not passed along if she can just get by.,PREMISE
975 I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher.,PREMISE
1342 I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else but I can see the public school system just isn't what it used to be and that's why I want to send her to private school.,PREMISE

478 Parents put their kids on a Public School Bus or drop them off at a Public School.  When they do they never know if they will ever see their child alive again,PREMISE
558 Kids are indoctrinated not educated in Public Schools.,PREMISE
593 Academics? Not in Public Schools.,PREMISE
192 where they can learn our faith as well as benefit from smaller class sizes and high academic expectations.,PREMISE
261 We enjoy being part of a very involved and caring school community.,PREMISE
676 it is not safe the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity.,PREMISE
1050 Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won't allow it.,PREMISE
305 If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I'd be saving money (not the school) - but I'd be not doing the best I can for my kids.,PREMISE
424 My kids are better educated  and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple.,PREMISE
731 In reality the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities.,PREMISE
1620 Think about kids in the public school classroom spending six to seven hours of their day with a group of only their same-aged peers. Where else in life do we spend such a large amount of time with only a group of people all the same age? In the workforce? No. Church? No. Social outings? Usually not. The public school classroom may be one of the few.,PREMISE
1791 Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence age-segregation and school bells.,PREMISE
2063 Homeschoolers on the other hand frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions. They visit museums,PREMISE
3007 The mass socialization within schools has brought about abundant delinquent behavior within our nation’s youth reports education researcher Dr. Michael Slavinski. He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs,PREMISE
3217 One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day.,PREMISE
3757 We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us. We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well. This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills.,PREMISE
381 So why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately?,PREMISE
594 Seriously do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms?,PREMISE
467 I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level. Many conversations with the Principal and teachers. He began to start not caring about school itselfhe was very bored. I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School. I made 7.50/hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school. It was the best investment I had made.,PREMISE
238 My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that's a big reason we sent her to Christian private school.  Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance.,PREMISE
424 The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways.  Just about every week cops are called to this school because of either a shooting/stabbing.  The neighboring county public schools are the same.  Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same.,PREMISE
141 I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives.,PREMISE
625 Also if your children attended this school parent involvement was an expectation. As a result,PREMISE
1095 The main problem with public schools is parent participation. What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids. There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result there is a tendancy for the parents to side (usually unfairly) with their kids.,PREMISE
94 I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society.,PREMISE
2093 Sometimes local public schools are themselves doing a poor job of educating students.,PREMISE
2209 Some parents feel that public schools will contradict the religious values they are attempting to teach their kids.,PREMISE
2572 And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend.,PREMISE
378 NO I will not subject my child to a bad education to a system that has done everything wrong for the last 30 years.,PREMISE
509 Instead of fixing the problem of what to teach we have a governing body that wanted to add class hours to an already bad system.,PREMISE
1037 It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago. The media coverage here and abroad about bullying teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant,PREMISE
859 My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3.8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes.  He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do.  Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions.,PREMISE
1389 While homeschooling is becoming more secularthe No. 1 reason (36%) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons. Actually after reading the comments,PREMISE
2260 Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers.,PREMISE
2402 Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding.,PREMISE
289 What you fail to appreciate is the actions of these bad parents helps keep your classrooms from getting overcrowded and keeps your taxes lower.,PREMISE
150 I really haven't met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right including myself.,PREMISE
1422 But if you're going to survive in it you have to know what you're up against. I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about,PREMISE
543 I would like to say that the programs that the public schools are pushing are bad and teaching children to become more dependant upon our government where private schools teach self responsibility and good character...,PREMISE
1154 now that is a refreshing statement for Ms. Benedikt to mull over along with all of her secular ideas that the public school system is pumping into our children.,PREMISE
291 they did not want me exposed to all of the crap that goes on in public schools. All the drugs swearing bullying,PREMISE
85 Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly.,PREMISE
161 Values can be promoted in accordance with the client population's choice.,PREMISE
356 We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools especially in the contemporary religious environment.,PREMISE
73 I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education.,PREMISE
307 The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math. This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies.,PREMISE
284 Children are taught not only the mandatory curriculum but also how to be considerate,PREMISE
2040 I don't think that the big school model is very effective. Children and teenagers can learn more from an education that is personalized supportive and based on learning and self satisfaction opposed to test scores and school funding.,PREMISE
528 Now days they do not do as much activity at school or at home.,PREMISE
110 Education is far too important to let the government do it.,PREMISE
249 I was ahead of my peers by high school. My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school.,PREMISE
386 Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively.,PREMISE
495 They can't bring home their books so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they've learned in school.,PREMISE
822 I also don't agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things. I think it sends the wrong message. The kids are coddled have no responsibility with the school system in this area.,PREMISE
155 More resources 2.,PREMISE
197 More respect for students and teachers 3.,PREMISE
244 More accountability for students and teachers.,PREMISE
331 My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children's education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system ..,PREMISE
290 Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people.,PREMISE
1537 Another point to be made is your peers if your a introvert than it doesn't really matter which school you go to on this point,PREMISE
1965 On the other side Homechoolers depending on where you live and possibly how you are homeschooled have homeschooling groups which not only have a large group of people,PREMISE
527 Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn't have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls.,PREMISE
690 Also while academic standards were high it was very much a 'survival of the fittest' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter.,PREMISE
901 We are finding the Catholic school much kinder and more supportive on the whole and also surprisingly stronger on things like social justice and inclusion of students with disabilities and that type of thing.,PREMISE
117 I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education.,PREMISE
584 In an increasingly complex global technological society all people need to have a basic understanding of science,PREMISE
960 Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster with ignorant uneducated,PREMISE
131 Private schoolsproducing more 1-dimensional bigots with an overblown sense of self-entitlement than any other education option...,PREMISE
268 Don't need statistics just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they're being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing i.e. bullying,PREMISE
744 Out in the Western suburbs where we can afford to live public high schools just won't do unless you're happy for your kids to be beaten up,PREMISE
915 Homeschooling allows you to tailor your education to whatever way helps you learn best.,PREMISE
1183 But when you put 30 kids in one classroom it becomes very difficult to teach them all individually.,PREMISE
1247 The public school system in most places is out of control.,PREMISE
1584 So in some cases there's a safety issue.,PREMISE
1942 Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying and failing a lot of other things too.,PREMISE
2143 You don't have as much busywork. I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences. Kids have too much homework; no one I know who goes to school gets enough sleep.,PREMISE
2263 There are exceptions to this but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers: you get healthier socialization!,PREMISE
2491 Plus you're exposed to a wider age range when you're homeschooled.,PREMISE
900 I couldn't abide that my own values of respect cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system.,PREMISE
781 I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with resources are good,PREMISE
1624 Ditto social justice and pastoral care. I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die. We were never formally told we just swept it under the carpet...i still feel gulity for never saying so sad for you,PREMISE
400 They did comment that private school students at their university experienced more difficulty than state school educated kids... and research indicates that coddled spoon-fed learners have trouble coping when that silver spoon disappears... .,PREMISE
803 I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in. To me learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit.,PREMISE
476 The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored.,PREMISE
641 They need to bring back classes where all children's needs are met not just the worst behaved why should the whole class be punished because one child's behaviour.,PREMISE
992 Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade. They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students.,PREMISE
3023 You want the best for your child but your child doesn’t need it. If you can afford private school (even if affording means scrimping and saving or taking out loans),PREMISE
4669 Also remember that there’s more to education than what’s taught. As rotten as my school’s English history science,PREMISE
2622 Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers. Doesn’t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons?,PREMISE
3029 Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques.,PREMISE
2217 These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received by either employing teachers who lack training and/or qualifications or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools. In India,PREMISE
1022 But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools rather than because of better practices. This distinction is crucial. The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students. If these schools were eliminated schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools.,PREMISE
1151 It's important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests.,PREMISE
1284 They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out. In short they operate entirely differently.,PREMISE
1066 These people have spoken about opportunities like sport and music programs that had not been available to us as public students,PREMISE
1253 The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we’d like.,PREMISE
1574 From my school experience public schools offered more diversity socially spiritually and ethnically,PREMISE
1845 On the other hand when your child excels in a particular area such as music,PREMISE
2668 Then there are the fees for education. Public schooling is by-and-large free with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars. Private schooling costs thousands of dollars. Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools regardless of the school’s wealth raised from fees and donations. Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend.,PREMISE
246 Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms and generally provide better facilities for students.,PREMISE
426 The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively.,PREMISE
750 Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say. This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things despite the fact that every student is unique and not all students fit into the same categories.,PREMISE
970 Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer the types of teachers they hire,PREMISE
1332 Since private schools compete with each other to gain students they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses. If a private school is not teaching its students well enough its graduation rate,PREMISE
1529 Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual’s educational needs.,PREMISE
1633 Additionally private schools are not encumbered by national teacher’s unions or political correctness.,PREMISE
1789 A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to and doesn’t need to ask the government for permission or funding.,PREMISE
353 My problem is when a parent doesn't put the effort in to socialize the kids they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group.,PREMISE
704 I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school and it is really easy to be like Well we'll get back on track tomorrow.,PREMISE
1114 Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves the only other con that I can see w/ homeschooling though is the socialization skills. I know there are other ways around it but to me,PREMISE
421 It is very costly but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love.,PREMISE
210 I simply don't have the desire or patience to be THAT present. Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24/7.,PREMISE
243 Imo it's not healthy for anyone.,PREMISE
418 Student who study in the private sector actually pay a fair amount of fees to do so and I believe that the students actually get let off for a lot more than anyone would in a public school. And its all because of the money.,PREMISE
627 In a private school a student being expelled or suspended is not just one student out the door its the rest of that students schooling life fees gone. Whereas in a public school,PREMISE
98 Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination what difference does it make?,PREMISE
200 The public education system has not failed it's got to deal with things that no private school does.,PREMISE
560 The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students.,PREMISE
822 At present intensive and focused teaching in a segregated classroom is more likely to result in acquisition of functional skills particularly where learning experiences incorporate real-world exposure.,PREMISE
947 The level of differentiated instruction required to develop some functional skills is not possible in mainstream classrooms.,PREMISE
1039 School and classroom design has not evolved and this has stagnated the inclusion movement.,PREMISE
1294 The reality is students with special needs are a small percentage of the population and cannot drive a fundamental shift in education.,PREMISE
380 The resources teacher (their aid) can't sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality.,PREMISE
591 The students can opt out of their accomodations and they do to save face further,PREMISE
811 Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students. SO while the lower performing student has an aid that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage.,PREMISE
783 Having multiple inclusion kids in a classroom can slow a class down. Even with aides a teacher often has to slow down and/or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors (saw this in my dcs' class last year which had multiple inclusion students,PREMISE
1163 The reg. classroom teacher who often is not special ed certified has his/her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class. Often,PREMISE
1532 As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his/her own learning not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created. The fact of the matter is that doing so (calming down a student) is not their job or their responsibility.,PREMISE
305 My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class.,PREMISE
512 I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention. In a class of 30+ this isn't going to happen consistently.,PREMISE
759 And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done. That impairs my efficiency as an educator.,PREMISE
940 Also some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom.,PREMISE
416 I agree too that although labels are scary for Parents with them,PREMISE
629 the government seem to think that making special needs kids go to mainstream will improve people's attitudes...it doesn't in my experience...they only did it to save money,PREMISE
1012 One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA's to children. The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit. They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times. Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made e.g IT provision in every lesson access to a scribe,PREMISE
411 BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly. A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD. A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD.,PREMISE
478 Many didn't speak at all had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting.,PREMISE
778 Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources. No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it's a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN.,PREMISE
1186 The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class (with a known teaching assistant). They usually went in for sessions like Art where the difference in ability is less obvious. This worked really well.,PREMISE
988 In a TEACH magazine article about his new book Adelman says inclusion of students with disabilities benefits entire student bodies by teaching kids about diversity in the real world and helping them develop empathy.,PREMISE
1147 “Friends must learn to accept one another’s limitations and flaws and to complement one another’s weaknesses by contributing their strengths” Adelman wrote.,PREMISE
1265 “Friends also quickly learn that superficial differences are far less important than shared values trust and humor.”,PREMISE
2518 The philosophy involves bringing support services to the child within the classroom instead of taking the student to the services and stipulates only that the child will benefit from being in the classroom.,PREMISE
3302 In a blog for Yahoo! Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money not an effort to do what’s best for students with disabilities.,PREMISE
3770 The cost for specialized services to children with disabilities far outweighs the cost of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms where they are unlikely to receive the specialized services they needClayton wrote. She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports.,PREMISE
1922 He has no behaviour problems and no physical demands that will affect other students in the classroom.,PREMISE
2210 I do believe that all students have the right to a good education and although this child is at a low academic level he still participates in class when prompted and the other students in the class still communicate and play with him even though he is significantly behind academically.,PREMISE
2428 If this child was to be in a special school/support unit the social skills he has now would be diminished and he may be at an even lower level than he is now as there are more interruptions than in a mainstream class.,PREMISE
2567 He still has one on one time with the special education teacher and is receiving great help from his class teacher now and from his peers.,PREMISE
685 Parents might think their child is not emotionally ready to leave home or not socially or academically adept.,PREMISE
822 Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports or to delay admission age to college.,PREMISE
2322 A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2011 said that starting kindergarten one year late substantially reduces the probability of repeating the third grade and meaningfully increases in tenth grade math and reading scores. Effects are highest for low income students and males. Alternately estimates suggest that entering kindergarten early may also have detrimental effect on future outcomes.,PREMISE
3508 Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was emotionally immature but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age. If he's older he won't be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this. He might feel more confident dealing with older students,PREMISE
3888 They sometimes are not ready to leave home at the age of five and the separation anxiety will impact them for a long time.,PREMISE
417 Around third grade everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes.,PREMISE
864 If all the others are graduating high school at 17why does he need to be there until he's 18? His whole life is delayed by a year. That's not a favour in my opinion.,PREMISE
526 I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn't ready but what I'm hearing a lot of in our area is parents (particularly of boys) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the class leader or the best in sports (which is ridiculous IMHO).,PREMISE
1392 Personally I'm not sending my kids to school to play sports. I'm sending them there to learn. Plus from my own sports experience,PREMISE
708 If she was down one grade it wouldn't make much difference socially since she is SO far off but she would be further ahead with academics totally bored,PREMISE
839 I don't necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school.,PREMISE
124 If a young five is already reading and doing basic math they can continue to develop those skills at home for another year.,PREMISE
257 She may be advanced academically but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that maturity-wise.,PREMISE
276 She was fineshe's in 2nd now and fine and every few months the difference between her and her peers gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Until Poof! its gone.,PREMISE
257 His confidence has improved so much being in a big kid school and being able to easily do all the work.,PREMISE
380 If he'd stayed in preschool it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn't play or socialize properly.,PREMISE
156 I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child,PREMISE
307 Or more likely it's a low to middle income parent,PREMISE
68 My kids would be bored to tears in Kindergarten if we waited a year.,PREMISE
269 I can't imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year. They would be so bored. So bored!,PREMISE
494 I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4.,PREMISE
985 I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone.

399 There are numerous studies on why people homeschool and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions values,PREMISE
1608 Dr. Densmore doesn’t believe that holding kids back from kindergarten entry is the total solution. It isn’t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds.,PREMISE
2815 And some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence. This may be because the children who parents initially thought were immature and in need of an additional year where actually exhibiting early symptoms of a larger problem and could have benefited from early intervention.,PREMISE
290 The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues. The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels.,PREMISE

881 Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming. Since there are no laid out plans for teaching homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents and occasionally confusing for children. Also,PREMISE
1337 Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates. This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports extracurricular activities or religious organizations. The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience.,PREMISE
1742 Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled. With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home the other is left to be sole breadwinner and that can place a burden on a family's budget. Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time something that cannot be offered while homeschooling.,PREMISE
2142 Children are isolated from differences in race ethnicity age and culture when being homeschooled. This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting. Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom.,PREMISE
437 I can't help wondering though what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids. Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually,PREMISE

688 OTOH one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline (school tries to parents object) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns.,PREMISE
438 What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents teachers notice and they report it. So some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught.,PREMISE
853 Just because the vast majority of home educators are good loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy.,PREMISE
614 You don't need school for this since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations. People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools. What schools actually promote of course,PREMISE
799 Home schooling on the other hand promotes independence,PREMISE
347 Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it... an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it.,PREMISE
163 The trouble is home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff.,PREMISE
681 I know one home-educated kid. His mum doesn't send him to school because she worries he'll get bullied. Actually he's much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely. As far as I can tell the education he receives at home is pretty minimal - nothing like what you'd get in school. I think it's a desperate shame - the poor kid is being deprived of an education and the opportunity to mix with other children.,PREMISE

100 I was home educated from aged 10 onwards; my parents were the most fantastic enthusiastic teachers.,BACKING

1192 It is ironic to say the least that in Dr. Brian Ray’s California studyaround 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired emotionally unstable,BACKING
480 The trend of homeschooling is indeed catching on with growth rate of 7 to 15 percent per year. It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program. They are reported to be performing on par with regular schoolchildren at college universities and at work.,BACKING

514 If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several (is it 6?) times a day and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly... why is this prayer only being conducted once per week? This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands. I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship.,BACKING
901 Time was the school day started with a prayer and yes,BACKING
123 Fact: Muslims pray five times daily in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting.,BACKING

456 Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance. I myself went to a co-ed and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend. The girls in my year just had entirely different interests.,BACKING

398 I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade. I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school.,BACKING
774 The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy (as they did in my co-ed school experiences).,BACKING
2362 The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew (all outside of school of course as it was an all-girls school). I didn't know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school,BACKING

3236 Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls' education doesn't necessarily improve academic performancebut they haven't found that it hurts either. A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes.,REBUTTAL
2309 Penn State's very own psychology professor Lynn S. Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling. That's not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse,REBUTTAL

295 Having said that a private education is no guarentee of a job nor that you will always have that job...,REBUTTAL
2088 There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school. Yes some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate. But many others go private for religious reasons or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues,REBUTTAL
5215 Many of my (morally bankrupt) colleagues send their children to private schools. I asked them to tell me why. Here is the response that most stuck with me: “In our upper-middle-class world it is hard not to pay for something if you can and you think it will be good for your kid.”,REBUTTAL
1040 The Lubienskis aren’t saying that public school students score higher because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher.,REBUTTAL
3866 Proponents of low-cost private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive.,REBUTTAL
1384 I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though (for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works) is that kids can learn at their own pace w/o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class.,REBUTTAL
144 Some mentioned that those who are educated in the public schools are less educated,REBUTTAL
109 It's certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children which seems to be the other alternative.,REBUTTAL
219 I believe that public are not a bad idea. Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school. Yes public school are overly populated but they give students a chance to get an education.,REBUTTAL
230 There are obviously cases where this isn't going to work. Extreme behavioral trouble kids that just aren't able to keep up with what they're learning in average classes etc.,REBUTTAL
310 Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved,REBUTTAL
42 In theory I absolutely support inclusion.,REBUTTAL
697 There can be however a few road blocks for special education students,REBUTTAL
1257 First students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability. As with any generalization there are exceptions to the rule,REBUTTAL
1923 Second special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan. Oftentimes their plan allows them to use notes,REBUTTAL
2600 Lastly special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load. I have always taken time to help as many students as possibleboth traditional and special education students. Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers' classes. I will have 10 special education students in one class period,REBUTTAL
299 Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups exceptional students and regular students in the same classroom.,REBUTTAL
443 The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter.,REBUTTAL
663 Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life.,REBUTTAL
2789 Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents.,REBUTTAL
374 child is tested delayed.,REBUTTAL
134 there is a documented need to do otherwise.,REBUTTAL
266 Parents should be able to keep their kids home an extra year if they believe their child isn't ready for the classroom environment,REBUTTAL
308 I'm all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready.,REBUTTAL
2227 So does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start? It appears that it can at least for the first few years of elementary school,REBUTTAL
138 Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade.,REBUTTAL
930 Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions.,REBUTTAL
1766 Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school. Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers' neighborhood schools.,REBUTTAL
2414 A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations.,REBUTTAL
65 Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace.,REBUTTAL
137 Homeschooling is beneficial for some.,REBUTTAL
168 I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would.,REBUTTAL
833 60 % of them were homeschooled badly were not up to speed had evidently not done much mixing,REBUTTAL
1537 He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse but provides no evidence to support this claim.,REBUTTAL
804 In those cases children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it.,REBUTTAL
892 I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans.,REBUTTAL
3361 Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling.,REFUTATION
3574 Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool.,REFUTATION
2157 However Dr. Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids. He made this children take the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales testwhich identifies well-adapted behaviors and maturity. Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile.,REFUTATION
186 They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork.,REFUTATION
767 our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools.,REFUTATION
3241 It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities.,REFUTATION
2257 I've never met them in reality.,REFUTATION
2126 None of these are compelling reasons.,REFUTATION
1188 But the private school student is likely to be wealthier come from a stable family not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma.,REFUTATION
4821 Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed and superficial research about improved learning outcomes. The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents. The latter point is crucial as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success. Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality,REFUTATION
324 However in private schools the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication.,REFUTATION
337 it also has drawbacks.,REFUTATION
93 In real life it hasn't worked so well for my son.,REFUTATION
2404 However evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers.,REFUTATION
1232 This may have been accurate in the past but today even if parents do not have the required skill set they have many options. Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise. Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula.,REFUTATION
2249 However the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature travel and culture,REFUTATION
2805 This argument simply does not stand as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation. In fact homeschooled children are often confident,REFUTATION
