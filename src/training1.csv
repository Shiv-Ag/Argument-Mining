TRUE,"Shermanator how little do you know about home education - your comment ""The development of these social skills is something that simply can't be duplicated in a home setting."" is totally ridiculous!

FALSE,Conversely - why keep your child home ever why not enter them into full time daycare from birth and let the state educate them from start to finish? Because your query makes as little sense.

TRUE,"The topic of home schooling is a difficult one whilst in some circumstances it is the most appropriate way for a child to learn and it seems that many of you who post here who have experience of home schooling are very dedicated and are doing a great job in other circumstances I don´t think that it is appropriate and through a lack of parental ability/knowledge of the area it may not be the best thing for the child.

TRUE,Purposely raising your children to be outcasts is child abuse I don't care what kind of cult you belong to. 	
TRUE,I'm always fasinated by the ideology argument. That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it! To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don't think that any other world view is acceptable or that you simple don't think? If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas. Early formal education adult-led activities single age classes each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability interest or other opportunities. One single ideology! Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori Steiner small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy. But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money and these schools are few and far between. Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate. They can use tutors courses other home educating parents older children other specialists with other skills and knowledge books science kits a bought curriculum internet resources etc etc. Home education is for most a community enterprise. Home educators come from many backgrounds with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured adult-led to the informal child-led. Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education or because they favour education methods not available in state schools. Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child. But they are guided by their own values beliefs and yes - ideology. But then everyone is. To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education. If we don't make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children. Whether the result is choosing a state school independent school or home education will depend on our children our selves and our family situations.

FALSE,"Good for you. I am pleased your children are so fortunate. However having actually been both in and out of state education I do not think that this is common. Certainly the fact that ""In 2003 an estimated 75 per cent of the adult population of working age had numeracy skills below the level of a good pass at GCSE and 56 per cent had literacy skills below this level"" suggests that I am not far wrong but of course all their parents may have taken an interest and just been rubbish at it... 	""I also think I was making it clear that I was not saying it IS the case just that from my experience this is what SEEMS to be the case.

And I'm not referring to comments against the Islam service taking place rather the comments labeling anyone who practices a faith as superstitious and implying their faith is no more than a fairy tale. The person who makes such comments has a very narrow definition of religion and their understanding of it is is one of a very fundamental view. As a person of faith I tend to see these attitudes as being no different then the religious fundamentalist who believes his way is the only way and all others are wrong. The argument that religion has caused more harm than good is old and rather tiring. The fact is if religion didn't exist evil still would be here. Those committing crimes and abuses would just be doing it with another reasoning behind it.

Maybe we should ban ALL extra-curricular activities from taking place anywhere on school property. In fact why stop there? we could ban the very thought of anything that is not school-related and sanctioned by the state. Except christmas of course.

FALSE,"WASHINGTON — The United States spends more than other developed nations on its students' education each year with parents and private foundations picking up more of the costs than in the past an international survey released Tuesday found. 	""Despite the spending U.S. students still trail their rivals on international tests.""

But U.S. salaries have not risen at the same pace as other nations and the United States is one of the few places where overall education spending has fallen since the economic crisis hit in 2008. 	""The findings part of a 440-page report put the United States' spending on its young people in context. ""	""The United States spent more than $11000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12000 per high school student. When researchers factored in the cost for programs after high school education such as college or vocational training the United States spent $15171 on each young person in the system – more than any other nation covered in the report. ""	""That sum was slightly higher than some developed countries and it far surpassed others. Switzerland's total spending per student was $14922 while Mexico averaged $2993 in 2010.

TRUE,After read this article undoubtedly I oppose the home-schooling intensely. A boy up to 16 who can hardly possess the fundamental kownledge of science geography and math. It is terrible especially in a country like USA with best education and most advanced technology which left the others far behind. Even though C.Powell is pretty responsible for the development of his children but the accountability seems to stand on the surface. The fact is badly apparent i.e when they children grow older they have to spend large amounts of time on remedial course and the extra energy as well. So the exemption is unreasonable. At this pointt I honestly expect the administration take relational measures to restrict the right of exemption for thoses people claim that they own the right of religious exemption . In this way not only the children are truly benefit from the deeds in the future but also the country as well. As to some specific measures the draft specify the local officials should test the children’s ability periodically. If the children could not reach the proper line. The law can dismiss the exemption for this family the children should attend to the public school. The draft of law aims to ensure every child in America accept the similar level education. Those who want their children left behind troops the law should punish them.
TRUE,No prayers in schools! Offend everybody equally!!	They do not belong. Pray on your own time.	
TRUE,"Ohhhh here we go again!!!! Where ever the Muslims go they expect ""special"" treatment. No religion in schools....this is what we've come to. In order to keep everyone satisfied there should be no religion in schools. If parents want their children to have religion they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship. Too bad if the Muslim children don't come back to classes after their prayers. That's their problem not the school's. For goodness sake it's just awful. Time was the school day started with a prayer and yes maybe religion classes but not nowadays..there would be full scale war. If the textbooks contain any reference to God there's trouble and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God or religion..or the hereafter..or what ever may have any religious connotation the children tell their parents and the parents complain!!!! So there you have it....yet more proof the multiculturalism doesn't work!! Thanks Mr. Trudeau; you've laid the goundwork that's the cause of making life in Canada a living hell...oh heck..was that a religious inference!!!!!! 	"
TRUE,There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required. That said should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack. None of us are perfect. What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision. That is scary for rest of us. Please stop reverse your decision and realize that religion all religions have no use in our education system our government and technically speaking (even those whom are dedicated to their faith) 98% of the hours with a calendar year. Our society just isn't gear for that. Ultimately we as a society lose.
FALSE,School boards are run by the left so no surprise that Islam gets special favor over Christianity and Judaism. 	
TRUE,"This is just silliness.	Fact	"" Muslims pray five times daily in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting. ""Fact	"" we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups. For example Jehovah's Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem because they only recognize the Kingdom of God. ""Both are reasonable accommodations. They do not impose significantly on the other traditions. I see no issue here. Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray. I'm good with that. 	"
TRUE,What about the minority of students who are not Muslim and are barred from using the cafeteria during the prayers? By allowing this prayer session in the school the TDSB is allowing discrimination and segregation. Non-Muslims are not permitted to participate and female students are required to stay behind the male students. Those who decided that allowing this to take place in a public school (apparently three years ago) should no longer have jobs. 	
TRUE,There should NOT be any praying in school. Praying is a home thing or a church temple synagogue or what have you exercise. 	Prayer is not for public consumption.	Our esteemed government should also change the words of the national anthem to eliminate the sentence that is a prayer. 	Canada is a secular nation. Let's keep it that way.

If my memory serves me correctly there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord's Prayer in schools yet this special status has been given to Muslim students in this case.

TRUE,"Our country operates under the US Constitution which is the Supreme Law of the Land the colonists of many beliefs cultures creeds and backgrounds fought and died for in the Revolutionary war to expel a distant omnipotent British King from interfering in their lives.

""The primary objective of schooling is to provide children with the tools necessary to go out into the world and support themselves so they will not be a burden upon society period. Religion is a personal choice that one accepts or rejects whereby 98% of children take on the beliefs of their parents. I know for A FACT Christians would be up in arms if they were forced to pray or accept Buddah so why they have come to believe its OK to force Buddists and others to pray to their religious icon (god) is beyond me. Don't get me wrong  I have no problem with a student conducting a SILENT prayer before a test eating lunch or easing some stress  but it should never be incorporated into the ciriculum or activities where children of many different beliefs/non-beliefs must go for the sole purpose of obtaining an education . ""	""This is exactly WHY our founding fathers incorporated the first amendment into the """"Bill of Rights"""" so no one religion could invade the freedoms liberty and rights of others to choose their own beliefs without interference especially from the government !

TRUE,There is a time and a place for everything including religion . Public School is not the place for religion unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course in which all views are examined. Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home by parents. If you want children to pray at school  there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available. Otherwise any discussion of religion should be strictly technical. 	
TRUE,"Children do not have the intellectual capacity to critically evaluate religious dogma. Teaching religion to children who are not capable of critical thought should be considered a form of child abuse. 	""Children believe in magic because they have not been educated enough to know when they are being deceived. Santa Clause can visit everyone's house on Christmas Eve! The Easter Bunny left you chocolate in the back yard! If you catch a Leprechaun you will get his pot of gold! The tooth fairy left you free money!

FALSE,Prayers wishes hopes to a god or generic spiritual theme are OK if there is no dogma attached Can we stop people from wishing or hoping? or is it just God the problem? In the big picture of a FREE SOCIETY --it requires a God concepta developing conscience and a general plan to enhance and ennoble society; otherwise we must fall under some kind of oppressive control Note that Godless Russia survived only with ruthless oppression. My personal thought is we must start building a God  virtue and idealism into our society as did our forefathers Agnostics atheistsshould appreciate the societal value. 	
FALSE,I don't believe that anyone is saying that students shouldn't be allowed to pray in school... in the form of an individual saying grace over lunch or before the start of a test... 	The issue is with official prayers read over the loudspeaker or otherwise directly sanctioned by school authorities. 	
TRUE,Why can't we have a moment of silence? I can see disallowing vocal prayer. A school is a public institution. It might offend some people. But say a classmate has died. Would a moment of silence be out of order? And during a moment of silence cannot some students pray and others reflect? 	
TRUE,As a student i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch. As far as a moment of silence during homeroom I say why not?. Children who don't want to pray don't have to and those who do can have their concentration to do so. A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words so why make a big deal of it?. I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want. 	
TRUE,"The bible says to pray in private. It also says to not use God's name in vain. It's ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues to not want ""In God We Trust"" on our money and to not want ""One nation under God"" in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven't earned that claim. Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things but I am quite concerned that God might be. As far as prayer in school I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate. 	"

FALSE,1) You basically just insulted the Christian God. 2) While I do believe in no help from God without the putting out of effort on the worshipper I do not believe as stated in a previous reply that prayer in the Christian religion is about asking for good things that you want but for the forgiveness of our trespasses and for the well being of those around us. IT is for spiritual protection forgiveness and for some it is a way to keep their heads high in this dismal world.

TRUE,I'm a teacher. If a student wishes to silently pray during my class I do not have a problem with it.

The U.S. Government cannot inforce or support the church and it’s ways. I have no set religion for I am unsure which is the right one for me. I believe that morals is a family constructed issue. You cannot blame the school for bad morals blame the household in which the students derive from. If anythinf there’s still private school out there to send our kids.

FALSE,"Let’s not blame the lack of prayer in school against the late Madeleine O’hare.

If all the Christians in America decided to stop at 10	00 AM on Thursday and joined in a collective prayer – who’s going to stop them? How bad do we want to pray in school – that’s the question? How bad did Daniel in the Bible want to pray? Bad enough that he was willing to put his life on the line. How many Christians “really” want prayer in school? How many are willing to go to prison for standing up? And if they put all the Christians in prison for praying – then who will pay the taxes to support the prisons?

FALSE,Amen brother. AMen	
FALSE,I know first hand that prayer in public schools is not dead. I am a christian but I attend a public secular college university. I attended a sports awards banquet last night. Before the meal we had and the ceremony an athletic staff member got up and delivered a public invocation or blessing for the meal and the ceremony. Surprisingly enough nobody stood up in anger or hatred. Nobody got up shouting pleas of detest. those who wanted to participated in the prayer and those who didnt simply sat there in silence and showed respect for those who did participate. As hard as the government tries they will never full banish religious practices in schools. God is too powerful and so are his believers 	
TRUE,I Don’t believe Prayer should be banned from school. yes it is a private and personal thing but students should have the ability to do it when they wish. Look at it from not a religious point. For instance sports people dont have to play the sport but some sign up. Prayer should be an option but not completly banned from schools. 	
TRUE,Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief trust and fear of God because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it.

But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don’t forget don’t do this … this and this… or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die. You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they’re religion or topics. Ignorance is truly bliss. Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form. I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray. But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they’re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else. Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe. Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work. You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids. Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything. Not all religious folks are good people. Not all prisoners are bad people. Hell not all bad people are BAD people. Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on. I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves “ You know what when I grow up I don’t want to be a fireman I want to hurt people”. That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do. Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they’re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong. O’ and side note all those parents that think that “Angry Music & Video Games” are the root of all evil and its what’s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society. YOU ARE IDIOTS. I apologize but your child may be playing violent video games and what not but when they go out and rape or shoot someone. It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting maybe you should have hit them those last few times. And if any of you are saying “Well what about the belt?” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists. ""	SOCIETY SIDE NOTE	"" The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God. It is because of what our society has become. Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL. That if someone is FEELING bad and they don’t FEEL like going to work today then they don’t. In today’s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility. I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn’t do what your father told you you were going to get the belt and you know what you sure never made that mistake again. Now you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him/her and your own child can sue you. People today are basically in my mind for a lack of a better word soft. I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through NO ONE (at 19 mind you). Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job. ""Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot. 	""In conclusion I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong. If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school. If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I’m sorry is not to learn about religion. It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be. Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience. Thank you for your time. ""	#NAME?"
TRUE,"Individual prayer is not banned from schools but school-sanctioned group prayer is and for a damn good reason. 	""Not permitting group prayer sessions in schools is not the same as kicking god out of schools. Not at ALL. And you are all doing a huge disrespect to people that have actually been put through pain and killed over their religious beliefs in other less-free nations and in other places in the past. To play this debate off as some kind of religious persecution only weakens your message to anyone with a shred of common sense. ""	""There’s absolutely nothing stopping kids from bringing God into schools with them in their hearts and minds. But public schools are an open secular institution. If you feel that your kid isn’t getting enough of God you need to stop blaming schools and instead step up to the plate yourself. ""	"
TRUE,"As you know We’ve been working real hard in our town to get prayer back in our schools. Finally the school board approved a plan of teacher-led prayer with the children participating at their own option. Children not wishing to participate were to be allowed to stand out in the hallway during prayer time. We hoped someone would sue us so we could go all the way to the supreme court and get the old devil-inspired ruling reversed. 	""Naturally we were all excited by the school board action. As you know our own little Billy (not so little any more though) is now in the second grade. Of course Margaret and I explained to him no matter what the other kids did he was going to stay in the classroom and participate. ""	""After the first day of school I asked him “How did the prayer time go?”""	“Fine.”	“Did many kids go out into the hallway?”	“Two.”	“Excellent. How did you like your teachers prayer?”	""“It was different dad. Real different from the way you pray.”""	“Oh? Like how?”	""“She said‘Hail Mary mother of God pray for us sinners…’”""	The next day I talked with the principal. I politely explained I wasn’t prejudiced against Catholics but I would appreciate Billy being transferred to a non-Catholic teacher. The principal said it would be done right away. 	""At supper that evening I asked Billy to say the blessings. He slipped out of his chair sat cross-legged closed his eyes raised his hand palms up in the air and began to hum. ""	""You’d better believe I was at the principal’s office at eight o’clock the next morning. “Look” I said. ‘I don’t really know much about these Transcendental Meditationists but I would feel a lot more comfortable If you could move Billy to a room where the teacher practices an older more established religion. ""	That afternoon I met Billy as soon as he walked in the door after school.	""“I don’t think you’re going to like Mrs. Nakasone’s prayer either Dad.”""	“Out with it.”	“She kept chanting Namu Amida Butsu…”	The following morning I was waiting for the principal in the school parking lot.	""“Look I don’t want my son praying to the Eternal Spirit of whatever to Buddha. I want him to have a teacher who prays in Jesus’ name!” ""	“What about Bertha Smith?”	“Excellent.”	I could hardly wait to hear about Mrs. Smith’s prayer. I was standing on the front steps of the school when the final bell rang. 	“Well?” I asked Billy as we walked towards the car.	“Okay.”	“Okay what?”	""“Mrs. Smith asked God to bless us and ended her prayer in Jesus’ name amen just like you.”""	I breathed a sigh of relief. “Now we’re getting some place.”	""“She even taught us a verse of scripture about prayer” said Billy.""	I beamed. “Wonderful. What was the verse?”	""“Lets see…” he mused for a moment. “And behold they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus calling him their Lord and their God.” ""	""We had reached the car. “Fantastic” I said reaching for the door handle. Then paused. I couldn’t place the scripture. ""	""“Billy did Mrs. Smith say what book that verse was from?”""	""“Third Nephi chapter 19 verse 18.”""	“Nephi what?”	""“Nephi” he said. “It’s in the Book of Mormon.”""	""The school board doesn’t meet for a month. I’ve given Billy very definite instructions that at prayer time each day he’s to go out into the hallway. I plan to be at that board meeting. If they don’t do something about this situation I’LL sue. I’LL take it all the way to the Supreme Court if I have to. I don’t need schools or anybody else teaching my son about religion. We can take care of that ourselves at home and at church thank you very much. """
FALSE,By the time he was 16 he had never written an essay. He didn’t know South Africa was a country. He couldn’t solve basic algebra problems.  	Sounds a lot like public school.
FALSE,who gives a crap if we can or can’t pray in schools im a student in high school and i pray whenever i want even thoe we aren’t supposed to… I don’t care they can’t stop me and like they would say anything they can’t put me in jail for it anyway there is a freedom of speech and i will exercise it to talk with god just because its talking with god doesn’t mean it isn’t talking. 	
TRUE,hi.i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools. i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation. only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man. He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes. prayer should be done openly and privately. please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence. invite the Lord in and watch the transformation.
TRUE,A little prayer never hurt anybody.	
TRUE,I will be using this article for my school assignment as well. Not because I am pro prayer in school but because I got stuck with the topic. Honestly i think that if people want to pray on their own time let them. But why must we have a mass function to pray? What about those who don't believe? Do you really need the whole school to pray at one time to reinforce your beliefs. If morality is declining its because of religion not getting taught in the home well. School has nothing to do with it 	
FALSE,Most people don't know the difference between weight and mass good luck home schoolers.	
TRUE,It’s amazing all the people who truly believe a simple prayer should be not be uttered in the public arena . Our Founding Fathers NEVER believed of supported this. They prayed in public and supported prayers given by public officials – recognizing the Divine help and guidance given in the forming of this Nation . The phrase ‘separation of church and State ‘ is not in the Constitution . That was a construct of the Warren Court . That phrase was written in a letter by Thomas Jefferson to a group of Baptists in Danbury Conn. He stated that the First Amendment would provide a wall of separation between the government and them so that the State could not hinder them from practicising their faith as they saw fit . That was the true origin of the phrase and it’s meaning . It no way and in no form did our Founding Fathers mean to eliminate prayer or faith from the public area . 	
TRUE,I agree. It’s time to get prayer in there. Our children are suffering. Our founding fathers were all Christian and we came here for religious freedom. It’s freedom of religion not freedom FROM religion. There’s a lot of jews and muslims in public schools but it will help them too. If we don’t get this country back for us we will be in trouble. We are a great country because of Jesus he helped us fight in world war II and now the fighting is here on our front door step. I can’t believe that the supreme court took prayer out of school. We need to get a real president with real Christian values. In fact every president we have ever had was Christian. We never had a jew as a president. doesn’t that mean something? There is no such thing as separation of church and state and let’s show the world that we’re not going to take this secularization of government any longer! 	
TRUE,People should be free to worship when where and who ever they want. All of you who want prayer out of schools keep saying go to a Christian school but why should we have to go to Christian school when the very foundation of the “public” was founded on Christianty? If you go to a school that did force prayer then I can see where you would be offended or upset but the majority of schools that had prayer did in no way force it on anyone. The first amendment does not say “separation of state and church” however it does say “FREEDOM OF RELIGION”. Why should the majority of Americans have to do something we don’t want just because a few people get offended? All of you nonbelievers are all for “do it quietly” or “go to a Christian school” but what makes you think we don’t get offended by that? Many of you say it shouldn’t be allowed and we are wrong for wanting it but what makes you think you are any better to not wanting it? It doesn’t seem fair that you can talk bad about our religion and the Lord in his self but we can’t talk good about Him. All of you are complaining about how we are trying to force our religion on you but look at yourselves you all a trying to force our religion out of us as well. 	
FALSE,I can’t help myself but I need to correct some errors that I read from an earlier post post #7 the 7th down (Patrick’s). It was Caesar Constintine who turned Rome into a Christian state not Alexander and he outlawed the persecution of Christians he didn’t pursecute those who were not. And it was the “Catholic church” not the “Church” (the church made up of all of the believers) that was straying from what the apostles had taught and were running the state and the reformation took place during the end of the Renaissance to the beginning of the Baroque periods not the Medieval period. And the separation of church and state in the constitution was so that a goverment couldn’t tell a person how to worship not the other way around. And the question is never “what is best for Christiantity” because Christ is who He is and He never changes nor does His word. You are either a Christian because you have believed on Him and trusted Him as your savior (a Christian; follower of Christ) or you haven’t (the lost; not a Christian.) I hope this helps anyone who might of been confused from earlier incorrect statements.
TRUE,I’m a 14-year-old student doing a research paper on prayer in schools. Alothough from most of the comments from the other users are mostly negetive prayer in school isn’t needed. Just because America doesn’t have an “official religion” doesn’t mean it’s going to “go down in ruins.” Nobody is as crazy as they were before the abolishment of prayer in schools.
TRUE,Satan has been building his Kingdom here on earth far to long; and we as Christians need to stand up and take back what God has given us. “Our Schools.” If you know your bible You know that Santan wants to be God. But GOD said the earth is the Lords and everything thats in it.The people and the fullness there of. America is a Christian nation. That means Jesus Christ is the center of everything we do. And I’m ready to take it to the President of the United States if I have to. Put Prayer and the Ten commandments and everything Godly back into our school. When I was growing up I looked forward to praise and singing hymns in class. I want to see my grandchilden honoring God in school as well. 	
TRUE,Rita I agree with everything you just said. We need GOD back in our School’s and kick Satan right out of out lives. Christians problem is that there letting the non-believers and Atheists take over our Beautiful Country…. IT’S TIME TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK TO OUR ONE true
TRUE,For those of you who seem to think that we’re blaming the schools well you need to re-read the article. It was the government that imposed the ban of prayer and those who didn’t pray had a moment of silence to begin each day. Praying by children at the beginning of each school day taught moral respect for everyone Christian and non-Christian alike. We learned to take ourselves and each other more seriously with everything we did. We held ourselves and each other accountable for our individual actions. 	
FALSE,I s-can any resumes I get that have even a whiff of home-schooling on them.	
TRUE,Wow anyone who does not believe prayer should be in school has not studied history. The fact is that as long as we were a praying nation in school and in government we were truly a blessed nation. Since that was removed almost 50 years ago we have been spiralling out of control. Just because you don’t believe something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Try reading the BIBLE and see what it says. Every knee will bow and toung confess that JESUS is LORD. You don’t have to believe it but it’s true.
FALSE,Homosexual marriage will be the ruin of the nation. I will fight against it until my last breath. It is one thing to allow it in homes and behind closed doors. It is an entirely detrimental issue when such perversions are shoved down the throats of children K-12.
TRUE,Ah yes the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts. I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility. 	
TRUE,since the shooting at chardon high school in ohio ive heard alot of people asking Why did God allow this to happen? NEWS FLASH EVERYONE God did not allow this to happen. The elected officials in the so called free America did they took God out of our schools It’s time that we take a stand and demand that God be invited back to our schools where he longs to be 	
FALSE,The only problem with your article is that the US Constitution DOES NOT support Christianity.	What they are doing wrong is interfering with the rights of the students WHO DO want to express their respect for The Creator as long as it does not collide with the rights of those who do not. 	Instead of an and/or situation we need a simple/basic law that will allow students to opt out of public prayer without getting in trouble so students who wish to follow can freely do so. 	The law does not have to be paragraph after paragraph long like how Atheists like to make their laws as complicated as can be. 	Also Extreme Atheists ARE banning people from being able to worship the Creator in public places like banning Christmas and taking God out of US coins. 	There are other stupid incidents but I cannot remember them all off the top of my head but in other words we are going down a dark spiritualess path. 	Right now in the entertainment industry things are either very naught with love for the self or very stupid NOT teaching you anything in a fun engaging way where you don’t fully realize you are being taught something. 	I miss the fun educational video games that had adventuring as a theme.	
FALSE,At this point in our history with government run schools that are failing by almost every standard it may be the time to shut them down. Open private schools that are free to teach religion have prayer Bible reading and let each parent decide where they want to send their child. This would be the American Freedom of choice and Free Market Place that gives you the best product at the best price. The government once it ruled on religious practice in the schools crossed that high wall which was to separate church and state. It did not rule impartially but rather it ruled against God. Parents would become more involved in their child's education once they were forced to make a decision on education. 	
TRUE,I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake Wa. Do you have any advice on how to start to get people together and have the law changed and to allow school prayer back so it will be constitutional? 	
TRUE,The rulers in that time shouldn't have banned prayers in schoolthey are going to be responsible for what we are seeing today its simple prayers in school filled with God are effective but if they are empty prayers surely those who don't believe might do whatever it takes to destroy our christian principles so listen up Christians don't let anyone do this! Stand up for what is right! Not what secular men say is right but you should stand up for what God thinks is right! Doesn't matter what people might say it matters more what God says about you! 	
TRUE,"1) There's no reason to suspect it matters. It is wasting valuable school time.	""2) The 1st amendment clearly establishes (heh heh get it) that the government may not sponsor a religion. There are many religions that do not pray to their gods and some that don't have any gods whatsoever. ""	""3) Not only that but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general. Prayer is solely religious in nature. ""	4) It forces children to think that religion is okay. It's not.	5) Religion is a touchy issue. There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been. 	6) Children are impressionable. Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not. 	""7) Dowant a fiery southern baptist leading your child in say non-Catholic prayers?""	""8) How many denominations should it encompass? Should there be separate prayers for Mormons LDS Muslims Catholics and Cult of Cthulhu adherents? ""	""9) In order for the prayers to be led by someone trained in leading prayers one would have to hire ministers. This is costly. ""	""10) What if a child dissents? What if the child's parents dissent? This could lead to costly court battles or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs. I am a victim of this latter possibility. Believe me I'm still trying to repair the damage. """
FALSE,Not very well informed at all. I didn't even bother applying to any universities when I got my GED; I just applied to open-admission community colleges. Even after a year of college coursework I was still rejected when I put in my application. Now that I'm wrapping up my second year I've got one application acceptance from a university. Still waiting on news from the other two. It does affect your ability to get in. Badly. 	
TRUE,"Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official (who is a gov't official if we are talking about public schools). Students can pray all they want together or by themselves and very few people actually argue against this at least I think. 	""I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance for that matter. ""	"
FALSE,How insulting. Just because they're communists doesn't delegitimize their lack of faith.	There are better ways of doing so. A mythology study class would be far more useful than forcing them to engage in the mythology themselves. Would you like to be forced to engage in Wicker Man-style Celtic fertility rites with the intention of 'bringing people together'? 	
FALSE,"When I said ""we"" I didn't mean like ""civil duty"". I was assuming the person was being used as a witness in a murder trial. 	""Does """"testifying"""" also apply to jury members? I'm not overly familiar with the court system.""	"
FALSE,"Yes you have to swear an oath for jury duty. First when you fill out the papers at jury selection that what you are stating is the truth and then in court during the selection process. After you're picked you're required to raise your right hand and repeat the the oath. I can't recall if ""so help me god"" was included in that oath or not. 	""I know depending on who's swearing you in in the military SHMG will be left out as well.""	"
TRUE,"This is an oddly personal topic for me. New York was where the case was. The day before the decision the teacher called me up and I didn't know the prayer by heartno one had told me I needed to memorize it. She made me stay until 5		""30. This was third grade I think. ""The New York prayer was inane	"" written not to offend pretty much anyone at the time. That way IMO it offended everyone. (Back then I kind of didn't care.) How can you write one that wouldn't be problematic? Unless we are to gut the right to religion or lackthereof no way. And no one should be forced to say or listen to any prayer. A moment of silence I have less of a problem depending upon how it is introduced each day. """"Enforced faith or enforced lack of it is wrong. However in High School and maybe Middle""	"" depending on how it's taught a comparative religion course that includes how faith and lack of it has been part of human history ""The result of my incident is that day the decision came down that day. The next day she skipped right over it. 	I thanked God that day.	"
FALSE,"I'm not sure how that is a response to my post. Do you mean by this statement that children do not have freedom of religion because they are not as you write full citizens? Your previous posts seem to indicate that you are against prayer in the schools because of the infringement on freedom of religion that it creates. Whose freedom of religion is infringed in mandatory school prayer sessions? 	""Also what dictates full citizenship and what does full citizenship mean? Children are minors dependents. They cannot vote and do some other things. It is a very difficult legal problem to define the rights of children. That is why I made the post. ""	"
TRUE,"Wow. This brings up a related topic about children's rights. Please look forif you're interested. 	""A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent's right to raise their children. If they wish to raise their children as atheists that is their right no matter what anyone thinks. So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith no matter how shallow on them? ""	""This is a sticky subject. Some think of evolution as teaching atheism. Some view much of what as taught as """"secularism."""" But none of this is praying to Darwin or claiming him or anything a deity. ""	""If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah Zoroaster Zeus and the Gods? Or recite over and over """"there is no God?"""" That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God. No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth he was no God as I'm sure all would say. ""	""This is where the difference is. Teaching things that contradicting any belief or lack of belief is one thing. Teaching """"God"""" and then praying to that deity is something else and just as problematic as teaching """"no God"""" then insisting all recite """"There is no God"""" at some point in the school day over and over. ""	""Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too and also showing similar respect to any other deity(ies) any of them might possibly believe in or their family does.

FALSE,"Of course fear was the motivator here a good portion of it from the House of Un-American Activities/Joseph McCarthy 50s... not all. But we also have to look at the wide group of settlers who came here before it was a nation to avoid religious persecution all too often to start their own more favored type of persecution. 	""There has always been some group driving for ideological/religious purity and I believe the thought that we have to have that in public schools is part of that drive. (Not labeling ALL who think it might be better just to be clear but I would think a lot.)

TRUE,"Isherwood	""Yes that's true but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts pray do homework for the class at hand etc. Sorry I can't quote the source but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence (not necessarily religiously related silence and/or prayer just silence) do much better in school because people don't realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought.

TRUE,The merits or demerits of single sex education is most difficult to conclude. In Trinidad and Tobago for examplethere has been a large scale move to make all public high schools not primary ones single sex. In my view the policy was ill thought out rest on little or no published researched and based on the assumptions that because a few single sex 'prestigious' schools do relatively well it justified the policy! What further gives this policy support strangely is the applaud of elitist and coveted racist groups that previously argued that mixed schools were designed to propagate race mixing! The fact is however that the policy does not fulfill stated educational goals but it creates yet another opportunity for segregationist to justify their ideology by pseudoscience. One wonders given what is published on wider American and Caribbean research if the single sex argument is not soon to be turned into a 'single ethnicity' one ending finally in a new apartheid system. ! 	
FALSE,i needed the info for a debate we are doing at school and this article really didn't help me with the cons of same sex schools.I really didn't like this article as this seemed as a one sided opinion 	
FALSE,im doing a report for school; the pros of coed school. this article really helped thanks a bunch!! 	
TRUE,Single sex schools are not good because they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do... you shoulkd post some things for debate teams. That is why I am doing this because of one of my classes. It is hard to find out things that are good about co-ed schools and bad things about single sex schools

TRUE,As a fellow Georgetown student who came from a similar background I can really identify with Josh. My parents opted to homeschool my younger brother and I starting in kindergarten. I was reading by 18 months and at a 9th grade reading level by the time I was 10 years old. I say this not as shameless self-promotion but to corroborate the fact that when well executed homeschooling can present a significant advantage to students in the early stages of their education. However there came a point (for me that was when I was about to enter 8th grade) when we reached a mutual decision in our family for my brother and I to attend public school. It was one of the best decisions we ever made. I was able to blossom intellectually thanks to the availability of teachers and advanced classes as well as develop socially; preparing me well for the collegiate experience. I am all for homeschooling in the early stages however education plays a fundamental role in the quality of life an individual enjoys therefore children should be allowed to have a choice as to whether they are homeschooled or not. At the very least those who are should have to comply with some form of federal oversight. To have kids well into their adolescent years unable to read locate countries on a map or do basic math (all situations I have personally encountered) is unacceptable. I am all for individual rights and religious freedom but it needs to be respected in such a way that it does not allow parents to circumvent the proper education of their children.

FALSE,Hi Guys I need to chose a high school for my daughters and my question is is it better to send gilrs to an all girls school or a co-ed environment. Both schools are great public schools with excellent reputations(Balwyn & Canterbury Girls) we are spoilt in that way but I want to make the best decision. Your opinions would be appreciated. Cheers Mr C 	
TRUE,Social education is important alongside academics. The real world is not segregated nor are universities. Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn't be sending my children to a single sex school. I'll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough. 	
TRUE,It'd be good to read up on the literature. My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events. I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren't just hormone driven.

TRUE,"I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools. 	""However if you want an opinon from a general education pespective and you can read up on this the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters.

TRUE,I would look at the subjects on offer. Sometimes single sex schools don't have the numbers (or enough interest) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes boys schools may not run home-ec classes. Also if girls schools don't have the interest/enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject. On the other hand it can work in the girls' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group.

TRUE,"Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance. I myself went to a co-ed and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend. The girls in my year just had entirely different interests. 	""In terms of results; I really think it's mostly up to the individual and how driven they are coupled together with a good teacher as to whether or not they do well.

"""
TRUE,"I went to an all boys school – Can't say I particularly liked it I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed. It is closer to the 'real world' that way.

TRUE,Studies have shown girls perform better (academically) in all-girls high schools than in co-ed. 	
TRUE,Can be either I've seen it go both ways! So I guess in that respect it doesn't really matter. I still think co-ed is more natural though. Interestingly the boys I know from single sex schools seem more against it than the girls and they do feel they were socially hampered a bit. 	
TRUE,"It is my understanding that in the state of Pennsylvania parents who home school must submit curricula to the school district. This provides at least a modicum of accountability.

TRUE,In a rough analogy to monocultural farming I think than any highly homogeneous group of people while it offers certain efficiencies is inherently pathology prone. Diversity damps extremes of outlook need and behavior. Ideally I don’t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age let alone sex. The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training. 	
TRUE,When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing. There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down. Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking. 	Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church. 	
TRUE,"I regard single sex education as bad. One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people. I don't think that home schooling is good for children and I don't think that single sex schooling is good for children either. In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals. They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people. In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women. This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment. 	""A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned. My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do. One friend of mine a product of a girl's high school had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course. ""	"
TRUE,"I am a scientist and I believe in data over anecdote yet I experienced the beneficial effects of single-sex education myself. After co-ed public high school and a freshman year at a co-ed university I transferred to a women's college and the difference was astonishing. Women spoke. Assertively. Being intellectual and smart was cool. Speaking up was cool. When I went to law school and later to grad school I could always pick out the women who attended women's colleges. We all could. 	""Sadly my college chose to go co-ed years ago. It left a hole in my heart. Had I a daughter I would encourage her to find single-sex schools. ""	"
FALSE,"This highlights the dangers of making any important decisions on the basis of social ""science."" The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education in substantial part on ""scientific"" evidence that separate but equal could not really yield equality. What would happen if that ""evidence"" were reinterpreted? The bottom line is that there is no real science behind the single-sex education debate. 	"
TRUE,Single sex education has been very good for girls especially. Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions. 	
TRUE,If there's a demand for single-sex schools those should be an option available to families. No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his/her will but I'm all in favor of voluntary selection into one. 	I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor. 	
FALSE,"This study once again confirms my long held suspicions that social science is not really ""science"" at all but that most ""social scientists"" are simply aging university leftists who throw around fancy jargon and use scientific terminology in order to give authority to their utopian agenda.

FALSE,I have no intention of waiting for scientists to reach agreement on this issue before I decide how I will educate my children. Leave us alone. 	
FALSE,Separate is never equal.	
FALSE,This is obviously an extremey bright kid with the gumption to challenge his parents. What happens with passive kids who do what their parents tell them without question and aren't as bright as this one? 	
TRUE,I think there is a huge different between separate classes for boys and girls where boys and girls are taught differently based on stereotypes about how boys and girls learn and single sex schools. I think single sex schools -- where all the leadership positions will be filled girls and all the math and science stars will be girls -- can be highly beneficial for girls. 	
TRUE,"There are serious problems in our public schools. They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork. 	""If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution get a grip. The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up.

TRUE,"Even if it were a good idea to separate children by learning style one could not reasonably infer a child's learning style from their genitalia. Maybe half of boys and half of girls would do better in a competitive atmosphere and the same in a collaborative one. But that still would not mean that society would benefit from children being spoon-fed in homogeneous groups when the real world is diverse and demands adaptation. 	""To everyone who thinks girls are better off in single-sex schools so that they don't invest time in being sexually desirable to men I would note that we might be better off working toward a society where girls don't see themselves as sex objects rather than designing institutions that say """"we think you can't learn around boys because you would have to spend so much time being a sex object."""" I went to school with boys but somehow I managed to see myself as a human being and to retain higher goals than being pretty. ""	Test scores would be an astoundingly poor way to judge the merits of single-sex education anyway. Testing well is not the goal. Succeeding in life is the goal. I shudder to imagine the losses we'd suffer in reducing the gender gap in the remaining boys' clubs like engineering and high level business management if women had to deal with men who had never in their lives had the experience of cooperating with a woman.

TRUE,Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt.Most Kids are distracteddo a lot of sextingindulge/experiment in sexual actsgo on emotional outbursts (act like adults!) and so on... Schooling is not a time for all such acts and learning falls by the wayside.No wonder why our educational standards are sliding.. Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school.some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools. Co-ed schools don't cultivate the cooperation or better understanding between the opposite sexes That's a myth...otherwise why would you have high rates of divorce and acrimony just a few years after they graduate out of co-ed schools and colleges? 	
TRUE,I attended a single sex high school some 40 years ago. Granted that was a different day but still I cherish the memory. Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction. If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation.
TRUE,I went to both public and private. The essential difference were the students. And it makes all the difference. The public school was a joke. 	
TRUE,"This is probably the worst argument against private schools that I have ever heard. Let's think about this rationale for a moment......  Let's simplify this and replace private schools with restaurants. If you ate at a restaurant and the service was horrible the food was bad the establishment was dirty etc. would you go back? Most likely you would not return. In fact you would probably make a mental note never to eat there again and maybe even tell a few of your friends about your experience. You certainly wouldn't recommend it. I don't know how anyone would come to the conclusion that if they just continued to patronize the restaurant and support it and make donations that the restaurant would improve. That's ridiculous logically you would move on and find somewhere else to eat. It would take weeks months and sometimes years to implement necessary changes to make the public school system better and that's IF you can get all the board members educators parents political figures etc. to agree on what's best what direction to go in how to do it and so on and so on. Meanwhile your children are not getting their needs met and they are growing up fast. Why would you sacrifice your child's education? I wouldn't I would go elsewhere somewhere where I knew my children were getting what they deserve.  On a side note you don't have to be wealthy parents to send your kids to a private school if you do your research you'll find that many private schools provide scholarships. So there aren't as many ""wealthy parents"" out there as Ms. Benedikt would have you believe. Besides those parents are still paying taxes to the public education system and their children are NOT utilizing those funds. Even with the extra money there are still no results. Ms. Benedikt must have gone to a public school her reasoning doesn't make any sense. I think she was was of those kids that ""slipped between the cracks"". 	"
TRUE,As a parent that sent her son to private schools I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment.  My husband and I (my parents too!) sacrificed a lot to give him this education.  As far as public schools go WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight??????   I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private.  So come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape!   Tina 	
TRUE,Ms.  Wong Benedikt's reason is in no-way-shape-or-from compelling.  It's a self confessed a manifesto.  It requires a jaundiced eye. While I'm all for public schools; both our kids attend.  Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time.  Additionally American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school. American parents have never given up their right to find the best solution for their child nor should they.  In the grey world it's perfectly possible to believe-in and support public school but choose a private school for your student. http	//www.admissionsquest.com/onboardingschools/2013/09/why-we-need-private-schools.html
TRUE,A totally wrongheaded argument.  I send my daughter to private school for a variety of reasons not the least of which are a curriculum and faculty that is superior.  BUT I nonetheless believe in the importance of our public school system and as such pay my share of taxes that support it AND donate time books and other support to our local public school. 	
FALSE,Is this writer that stupid???????? I am 60 and no children and there are more than you think. We have put tax money in the system for years but the kids learn less and the teachers know less. Only the unions profit.
FALSE,Just for the record I am as opposed to hippies who raise their kids on communes Mormons who marry off 14 year old girls anti-vaccination weirdos and everyone else who fails to protect the safety of their kids and raise them to compete in a modern world.

Should we blame (or sue) our firefighters for our insistence on (or resistance to) not learning?  C'mon.  Jeez.  Parents of students are responsible for their own childrens' failures or successes.

I would no more have helped my son with his grade 9 math (that I couldn't do let alone know how to teach) than my Belgium next-door neighbor wants to help her daughter with her English writing skills.  Let parents...parent.  Let teachers...teach. Let firefighters...fight the fires.  OF COURSE we should all help each other (and should--if we're capable) but most of us who are capable firefighters are not necessarily capable math teachers and those of us who are capable parents are not necessarily capable teachers and those of us... you get my drift. Sanity?  Logic anyone?  Parent-involvement in schools is akin to teacher involvement in firefighting.

FALSE,"If I had not taught at a school where there were gun fights in the parking lot and teachers were robbed at gun point I still would not think that sending rich children to public schools would improve the schools.  If they're bright kids they will be put into IB/ AP classes or into magnet schools. No improvement needed there.  If they are behavioral problems or not too bright they might fit right in to the general population.  They could also pull the ""Do you know who I am"" routine? to impress the teachers and administrators with the power they possess. ""I'll tell my Daddy and you'll get fired!"" Let's fix the public schools by creating vocational schools so that those who are not interested in careers that require college educations can come out of school capable of earning a living. Let's put teachers back in charge of the classrooms.   Let's stop making ridiculous academic requirements of our kids.  Unless you are aiming at being an engineer you do not need to know quadratic equations.  Why on earth do we require Algebra II for graduation? How many kids learn to speak a foreign language in school? We water down the more difficult classes so that the students who are not capable of doing the actual work can pass the course.  I saw a boy who could not add whole numbers put into an algebra class.  We have lost our minds. 	"
TRUE,Some of the public schools around my hometown weren't just bad they were dangerous. Fights and gangs (yes gangs in middle schools!) made it easy for parents to choose to send their kid to private schools even when it meant living on a strict budget just to pay tuition. I understand her argument and yes the schools in my hometown continued to decline but it was because parents who had the money or the strength to speak up about education sent their kids elsewhere out of fear. Her point is noble and just but when it comes to looking at your own son or daughter and a public school full of drugs and gangs you're not going to risk your own child's life just to make a political point. 	
TRUE,Does it not strike anyone as ironic that the parents who are considered idiots and uneducated are most likely all products of the public school sytem? Home schooling as it is known today is a fairly recent (80's and on) trend.
TRUE,"It is absolutely correct.   The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria.  They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies.  Public schools have neither option.  So no special education no behavior problems and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education.   More to the point US public schools are the best in the world.  They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability income behavior etc...  Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for ""career"" training at their ""ability level.""  If students fail the high-stakes test in America schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade again because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability.  This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level.   With private schools stealing students away from public schools the problem is exacerbated further.  Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite.  The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue.  More over they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended. In light of that fact there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools	"" 1) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism or 2) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are """"better"""" than their public counterparts.

Also I know that I could have home-schooling my children because I have a very high level of education but I would not have the patient to do that and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland; my oldest son is a biologist (Salisbury University) with three masters my second son is a mathematician (MIT) and my third son is a mechanical engineer (College Park). I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities	"" I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad. My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland and the three of them attended excellent universities. My second son whom graduated from MIT received a “Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names. So the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard Stanford Yale etc. is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony. From the students I taught that were home-schooling only one was exceptional brilliant he got a very high score in the SAT and he attended the University of Maryland College Park to study engineering. No everybody can teach and learn at home and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “As” as possible on their resu """
TRUE,"Is it wrong for parents to send their kids to private schools? That's the title of this article. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! What is this China for crying out loud!?!?!? Give me a cotton-picking break!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Parents can send their children to whatever schools they want! Period. Pay attention to the United States Constitution!   This is a free country at least for now... And unless you want to subject parents to anti-American communist laws; then stick your nose where it belongs and attend to your own children! No one should have the right to send children to any school except for the actual parents of that individual child!   Private schools are absolutely fantastic! Homeschooling is even better! Charter schools are the answer for public schools! Face it! The public school system is failing our children especially in the inner cities because it's the government that runs it. The argument should rather be for taking our children out of government run schools.   Use the same extensive amounts of money we all throw into the public school system via our taxes and give it to private charter schools and watch them absolutely thrive! That's the answer. And it's happening all over the US. We have awesome teachers in so many parts of this country including a ton inside our public schools.   However take the unions out of the picture fire all the bad teachers out there and put a performance-based system in place for a privately run charter school system throughout the country. Then take the incredible amount of money that we all pay through our taxes and put it into privately-run charter school systems that aren't mandated to indoctrinate our kids with all sorts of filth and error.   Our public school system is failing our children. So many of our children in America are being taught flat-out lies revisionist history and/or watered down historical inaccuracies. Every subject (math science language arts social studies etc.) in our public schools is being dumbed down to substandard education. We've got an idiotic student to teacher ratio. It's no wonder public school kids don't know basic facts. Here's just a few stats	"" 　 Only 43 percent of all U.S. high school students have any idea the Civil War was fought in the 19th century. ·More than 65% of all U.S. high school students cannot find Great Britain on a map.   Twelve percent of U.S. high school students cannot find the United States on a map.   More than 25% of all U.S. high school students thought that Christopher Columbus made his famous voyage across the Atlantic Ocean after the year 1750.   About 33% of all U.S. high school students do not know that the Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of speech religion and due process.   Only 55% of all U.S. students can name the Vice-President.   We need children with well-trained minds. Speaking of which there's a fantastic book on classical education titled""		"" """"Is it wrong for parents to send kids to private schools?"""" Please refer to the answers in my first paragraph. """
TRUE,The woman is a nut case! Lib mentality on crack! Maybe this woman needs to work and give all her money to the public school system so she won't be a bad person. My children and I all went to public schools. Hated it for them just as much as for myself. If there had been anyway possible that I could have sent them to private school. You betcha I would have. I think private schools are great and hope a lot more come about. I feel the private schools up the expectations and standards for the public school system. That's a good thing. And that's what scares these selfish people that want to take away people's freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do!  After all the public school systems get tax money from everyone even from the one's who send their kids to private schools. And the public school doesn't provide anything for those kids but the system still takes their money. 	
FALSE,Interesting that religion is a less compelling reason.	
FALSE,"The rational of this argument is not logical.  No one is to blame for poor public schools except for the public schools.  The ""entitlement"" suggestion that it is always someone else's fault is simply without any plausible reason to support this claim.  In fact it is very much ignorant.  There is no research to support this claim.  If a school is bad then it is the people within the school that need to stand up and put the effort into changing it.  Also there is no evidence that says ""more money"" will help a school improve.  It is the people that work there their motivation their ability to work together in a collaborative way and their ability to strive for success and to teach resilience.  You can't blame someone else who isn't even there.   Goodness goodness we spend more time whining than simply working hard and doing a good job. 	"
FALSE,<cough> white liberal guilt <cough>	
TRUE,I didn’t have the opportunity many have of going to a private school but I have to say that my life isn’t less good than any one who has had that opportunity.   I worked 10 yrs for a company where most of the employee under my wing went to some of the most prestige private schools and collages in my area.  I don’t agree that sending your children to a private school makes you a bad person but I do have to disagree with those who criticize public schools. The values that you teach you children at home along with extra encouragement and attention is all a child needs to succeed in any school whether it’s a private or public.
FALSE,What an asinine question. It's only wrong if you think it's wrong to send your children to private school.. 	
TRUE,"Ok....if you're going to make a point based on a snap shot (parents blame game) and consider what you see ""big picture"" how relevant is this story? The real story in many public school systems in the US is accessibility resources not meeting the standards of local and state municipalities all the while producing less than the worlds youngest and brightest. Environmentally speaking many buildings are not up to code (health risk – air quality) are burdensome regarding devalued property (dilapidated) a generator of many things bad (dietary etc.) teacher’s salaries unions and the list goes on. I side with the author on overcoming against the odds (with proper support). This factor is not one that fits the mold of the average person and not should be taken lightly as it does not apply to the average U.S. citizen. I sense the notion that public education isn’t required to be performed in a traditional school setting but may/should take place at the home with the parent(s).  So “YES” parents are wrong for paying taxes for participating in a not failing but “failed” public education system. Parents are obligated to be advocates for their children. Moving to a better zip code is not the option for the vast majority. Here’s the kicker what level of commitment is required to educate in the home? Do most households have the elements for educating students? Social development is very much needed in today’s global/international market(s). There’s no easy answer. To say parents are at fault is an easy way to get feedback/pulse in order to extract information from readers. No true, experienced writer is this naive! Our nation is faced with deciding quality of the short vs. long-term future and fabric of our nation. Taxes vs. balanced books/budgets are an ever growing challenge. The short cut to success in the eyes of attaining $/wealth is to require history classes of how the top 1% became the top 1% for K-12 grades. If you’re home schooled attend public or private school the exposure to what actually works and what it takes/took to reach the top is the reality students need to understand as well as parents. For those is think and say $/wealth is not everything I suggest “power” be the topic! Don’t be fooled …”the schools will get better”. Better at what? The reshaping of this great nation will be more than attaining $/wealth. Sustainability on most if not all fronts must be the goal! Sorry to have carried on but I don’t think the author of this article considered the audience to have been entrenched in the rearing of children. However I urge K. Wong to publish a strong comeback article given the feedback I’ve seen from readers. Note	"" if the K. Wong is a parent who has actually tried this and is a witness to things having improved by taking her own children from private school (whom in many cases exposes students closure to the 1%) and placing them in a public low performing school I say that history tells us that those who derail from what’s “norm” make it to the top 1%! If you don’t do all you can for your children regarding education it will show. If your children do not take to the education you’ve provided it will show. """
FALSE,The public schools are doing it themselves as well.  The same argument could be made for magnet schools.  You are taking the best and brightest along with parents who care out of their home area schools and put them in a magnet school.  This leaves the lower level students and parents who don't care left in the local area schools.   If pulling good parents out of the public neighborhood schools is bad for public schools then quit bussing the smart kids out of their home areas and leave them in the neighborhood schools.    Our obligation is to our own children first.  Even if my public school is providing a safe an excellent education (which mine is)  I should be able to send my children to a Catholic Jewish Buddhist or secular private school if I believe that is in the best interest of my child.  My child is not a pawn to be used to better a system that is slow to improve. 	
TRUE,DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE CALLING ME A BAD PARENT!  I am not wealthy my daughter went to both private public and back to private. Even with a reputation of a good school district I have a child with special needs. She had no time to sit on a waiting list for services secluded programs as I was even willing to pay. I fought for her her doctors fought for her with zero results. I made those payments I gave up vacations and even my car. Today she works goes to a great college does not live off a system. Let me remind you the public school wanted to keep her until she was 21! To do what? By now she has two years of college in working on Chemical Engineer Degree.  She works to pay for college. Not to  live on a system that would have done nothing but spent your money. NOW CALL ME A BAD PARENT!!!
TRUE,I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins. Any parent and I do mean any that would do less for their children than they are able to are guilty of child abuse. If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to then it is clear that you love money more than your children. Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools. Just who do you think pays for the schools? They pay most if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools. Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also. A very few excel but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling so they exceled in spite of public schools. What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something. If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control. When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them. The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them. 	
FALSE,The author needs to stop assuming that the readers are as uneducated as she is. I think that vouchers would help some students get a much better education. Let's see now which political party controls the public school system? It's the same one that is totally against vouchers. Hmmm. 	
TRUE,BIG E.what about all the money we do send to our schools .does it help our child. no .teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike .well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	
TRUE,as far as this article goes just like most of the public school teachers I have meet are completely lacking in common sense. EDUCATED FOOLS so is the writer of the article. what parent with even a minimal amount of common sense would use their child as a pawn to better a broken system if they are able to enroll that child into a system that cares about that childs education. 	
TRUE,Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them.  The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way.  Private teachers have more passion about teaching  because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole.  Children in the public school systems ARE left behind bullied and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities. When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school?
TRUE,Does Allison Benedikt have children?  All my children went to public school.  But I had to move to a location in a good school district.  The location where I did live lacked good teachers and good curriculum.  Sure my children would have excelled in that school but they would never been challenged.  In the Pendleton Heights school system my children excelled and were challenged.  Parents should always have the welfare of their at the top of the list.  If that includes enrolling them in a private school so be it. That doesn't make them bad people. 	
FALSE,What a stupid article.  Must be a member of the teachers union.	
TRUE,The parents of the kids in private schools still pay the property taxes (80% goes for public schools). So in reality it’s better for the public schools less customers but still getting the same amount of money.
TRUE,so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out....news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time.... 	
TRUE,Two kids in private school. Excellent education. Kids are happy. Allison.....STFU!!	
TRUE,This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read!  We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school.  I helped paint classrooms and wash windows.  My husband helped update plumbing.  Other parents did landscaping waxed floors supervised recess helped in the kitchen  repaired the furnace and water heater maintained the school bus and re-sealed the driveway.  This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system.  On top of all this we also paid taxes to the public school.  If public school parents don't like their 'crappy' school then let THEM make changes.  We have done our share. 	
TRUE,I taught in public high schools for 15 years.  My advice to parents?  Run don't walk to the nearest private school.  Public schools are not about education; they are about social engineering.  Parents had a stake in their public schools when they were neighborhood schools.  Neighborhood schools were community gathering places where parents kids and teachers all came together and all knew each other.  My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium. One high school where I taught had almost 2000 students; what passed for PTA meetings were held in the principal's office.  The school board for my system was made up of lay people each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education.  In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools.  Public schools are fad driven.  Remember new math?  Of course not.  No one does.  Cooperative education?  Social advancement?  Mainstreaming?  At the Tech school where I taught seniors once had five hours of shop class in the trade they came there to learn.  Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum.  When I left that school seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need desire or use.  Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose.
TRUE,"I do support public schools with my taxes. I then send my children to a private school to instill moral behavior and God in their lives. This nation was founded ""under God"" (the pledge of allegiance). Look at all the references to God in our nations capital. The inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial states ""this nation under God shall have a new freedom"" At the very top of the Washington monument are the words ""praise be to God"" The inscription on  the Jefferson Memorial ""God who gives us life gives us liberty"". When the President gives his State of the Union address above his head are the words ""In God We Trust"". These are just a few examples. Why is it then when in our public schools we can't mention or refer to God in any manner? 	"
FALSE,"I went to public schools in Baltimore City MD. They have consistently ranked in the bottom for decades. I currently send my own sons to public school (they have also attended private/religious schools in the past) one that is just recently improving and offering more AP courses in AZ.  I am a highly successful professional went on the earn multiple college degrees and certifications. My sons are also excelling and I could not be prouder of their efforts.  Education is a private choice but I have found that regardless of whether you attend public or private schools (I have met total losers drug addicts and criminals from BOTH public and private schools) the outcome depends on the support the parent (s) provide at home. A child will imitate mom and dad. If mom and dad are supportive educated and active in the child's progress the child will do well and go on to be successful. The school is irrelevant. These parents demanding isolation of their kids from ""the bad people"" are not helping them. To be successful in life children need exposure and interaction with all types of people different skin color religions values in order to create their own identity and be prepared for what lies ahead when they are on their own at college and future jobs. Ultimately mom and dad you are your child's compass not whatever school you choose to place them in. Take charge of your child's education you will only see good outcomes. 	"
FALSE,I don't understand why the children aren't allowed to enroll in public school. I don't have a problem with parents wanting to home school their children but once the child reaches a certain age they should be permitted to makes some decisions with regards to their schooling including attending local schools. The fact that the County refuses to do more with regards to the Powell children in spite of the evidence that their education is lacking is appalling to me. And if Mr. Powell is going to continue to educate the children at home he needs to get someone to help him. 	
FALSE,I THINK EVERY KID SHOULD BE TAUGHT GOD'S WORD EARLY WITH ONE CLASS IN BIBLE STUDY. SINCE GETTING INTO GOD'S WORD DEEPLY ABOUT 9 YEARS AGO I AM HUMBLED IN WHAT I DID NOT KNOW
FALSE,"Many of the people in this forum are citing ""Freedom of choice."" I am willing to bet those same people are the ones who want to tell me I don't have a choice when it comes to what I do with my body and who I marry. 	"
FALSE,I think all schools should be paid for.	
TRUE,"I send my child to a private school not only because they can pray and use the word ""God"" but because a private school can get rid of a bad teacher at any time. Public school teachers have a union that allows them to continue to work because they have ""X"" number of years. Public school teachers should continue to get better continue their education and be held accountable for the product that they put out. I'm certainly not a ""wealthy"" person but choose to send my child to a private school because all the parents at the school care about their child and doesn't depend on the school and the teachers to raise the child. Bad parents send their child to a public school and think they don't need to be involved with the education of their own child. Not all parents of public school kids are bad but none at a private school think that it is the schools responsibility to education the child. 	"
TRUE,PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE LIBERALLY SLANTED AND DO NOT TEACH KIDS THE CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS. ALSO IF GOD IS NOT PART OF THE EQUATION YOU CAN FORGET IT. UNIONS AND THE LIBERALS DESTROY EVERYTHING THEY TOUCH EVEN EDUCATION 	
TRUE,Absolutely stupid person why do we have children? To send to an immoral government run pig farm? No but to give to our children all the best that we as parents can! 	
TRUE,"Public school systems teach ""Common Core"" a totally Socialist/communist slanted education replacing history books with books full of crap not facts. They don't teach they indoctrinate! 	"
FALSE,This is all communist-minded dribble.  Equalize everyone and everything don't dare do what's best for your kid becuase in some obscure imaginative way it might hurt the masses of people?   If this person really wants to fix public schools kick out the non-performers who don't learn anything and don't care anyway.  Focus your resources on the investments that pay off.  Divert your money away from the money pits.   Oh nevermind I'm talking to a far left communist this makes no sense to those types. 	
FALSE,"Whether parents send their kids to public or private does not impact the quality of the public school system because the school system is partially funded through real estate taxes that homeowners pay. One could look at it that families that are not homeowners don't contribute to the school system yet enjoy the services while homeowners who do pay taxes and choose to send their kids to a private school are effectively paying twice. Should they get a rebate? Labeling parents who select private schools as ""mean"" is rather juvenile but perhaps the writer is illustrating through personal example the problems with the public school systemthe inability to concisely present an argument without resorting to name-calling.....

FALSE,Even in backwards New Mexico parents have to register that they are home schooling their children what materials they are using (there's an approved list) the students have to take the standards based assessments and the state trackes their progress. 	
TRUE,"I could care less if she thinks I am a bad parent. I have a responsibility to my Child to do the best I can for her and sending her to the public school system to be endoctronated into the ""moral standards""( or lack there of ) that the Government standards dictate is NOT what is best for her.  And We are going to do everything in our power to follow that conviction. 	"
FALSE,Simply put and resorting to childish antics of name calling which the writer of the article can understand maybeMoron. 
FALSE,You are a bad parent if you do not get your child the best education that is feasible for him/her under your circumstances.  The notion that your child(ren) should be used to indulge some social agenda is pathetic. 	
TRUE,"I am perturbed that Mr. Powell's sister claims that many of her younger siblings spend ""most of the day"" playing video games - is that educational? I strongly doubt it. Sounds to me as though Mrs. Powell is overwhelmed by having to tend to the education of at least 8 children at home and lets them do as they will. 	""A sibling who can't read by middle school? If the kid is dyslexic is he doomed because his parents won't/ don't/ can't get assistance for how to handle such a learning challenge? There needs to be some checking in on the homeschooled students' progress. ""	""Again Mr. Powell succeeds because he is motivated and very smart; his siblings may not be so motivated but they deserve to at least learn to read by age 12. Especially if they go into construction or farming - there are many permits/forms to fill out and people who cannot keep up will end up itinerant laborers - hardly what their parents intended. """
FALSE,Typical democrat!  If we just gave all of our money to the government they would know better what to do with it. We just need to rely on the people who overspend and don't care rather than focus on our own families. 	
TRUE,If you can afford private school then do it. Not only will your children receive a better education they will be exposed to far less bullying. I have four grandchildren in private school. Money well spent. 	
TRUE,So I am suppose to sacrifice my child education for the sake of the countries? It was shitty prior to her birth or mine?  I am a single mother and I make less than most people and I am sending my child to a private school.  So I guess I am a bad person! 	
TRUE,I wouldn't go as far as calling the people sending their children to private schools bad people but I do agree with the fundamental premise that people not using the system is what makes it bad in places.  I also agree with  her that the students that are sent to privates are the exact students who would do well in pretty much any school as well as those being the parents that would truly make a difference in the public schools.  I'm not advocating that anyone make that sacrifice But I do believe that she is correct in the difference it would make in schools.  The schools would become what the parents want them to be.  I'm writing my master's thesis on this very subject and its interesting to hear the testimonials of different parents that made different choices. And those asking why should they send their children to these schools.  Well I would just say the more educated a society the less crime their is the less poverty there is the less sociological and psychological problems for anyone living in that society.  I get that its philosophically American to go it alone and forge one's own path but that's often not true and even in a private school the students are benefitting from the support and environment of that school.  Real life is no different but we often feel differently when that environment involves people that might be a little different from ourselves. 	
TRUE,The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore. I remember when they started teaching in Spanish in the early 1990s in Illinois. My kids didn't speak Spanish so I pulled them out and they went to private schools after that. It's pretty bad when we have to raise kids that don't belong here. Also the private schools don't teach all of this anti American social justice crap. Private schools don't promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles. Just look at the law that California governor Brown signed a couple of weeks ago. It says that transvestites can use either bathroom facilities and that they can play on either team in sports male or female. Just do what's best for your kids.
FALSE,Can't take that chance with those I hold the dearest to me. Just like I find the best area to raise my kids so it is where they are educated. 	
FALSE,I wish all the baggers would keep their kids away from normal people.	
TRUE,"Wanting my children to recieve a religious education is a ""less compelling"" reason to go to private school?    ""... with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education — the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy ...""   Are my children supposed to be fodder to improve the system? No thank you. 	"
TRUE,I agree that this article is a crock! My wife and I are both school teachers. I worked in the public system and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area. We are also far from rich. So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector? One major reason - God is not allowed in the public schools but He is more than welcomed in the private! So I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost. Isn't this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms! 	
TRUE,"Public schools vary greatly across the nation; some are as good as ""elite"" private schools and others can be deplorable. Neighbors peer groups and the educators they attract are critical.   Lost in this discussion seems to be the fundamental reason our nation has public schools	"" to develop citizens who embody knowledge skills and character along with a continued thirst for learning. We all support public schools through tax dollars and we all have a stake in the outcome of any child's education.   Our schools are here not just to serve the public but to create a """"public."""" A private school also might accomplish this but has no civic obligation to do so and many don't. If your public schools fall short then we all need to work for change. When a nation does this well we have reconciled and found the essential balance between """"individualism"""" and """"republicanism."""" """
TRUE,I sent my child to a private all girls Catholic Academy. She was Valedictorian with a 4.38 GPA (out of 4)  Yes she probably would have done well in our local school system. BUT admissions officers would not have paid nearly as much attention to her.  As it is she got a $30000 per year SCHOLARSHIP to a prestigious Engineering research university.   Don't punish me and my child because other parents don't appear to want to spend the time with them to forward their advancement.
FALSE,It is no one's business where someone decides to send their children to school or for what reason. I resent someone saying because I send my children to a private school I am hurting the public system. I have taught in both private and public schools.  I have witnessed a much more  disciplined approach in the private system and children  learn better when not distracted by children who have not experienced  proper authority. Not all public schools are bad and not all private schools are good. I should be allowed to choose according to my own standards without criticism. 	
TRUE,I am a homeowner and pay taxes for my public school system - HIGH taxes at that.  However I still choose to send my daughter to a private school.  Part of the reason is because of the individual attention she receives in class public schools can no longer offer such quality time with students.  I have many friends who have their children in the public school system and I can see the difference in the education they are receiving.  My daughter started to come with homework in PreK she learned how to read by the end of that same PreK year.  While my friends children where still learnign the alphabet.  The discipline and advanced opportunity has given her a jump start in life something that is needed in a world that is moving so fast.  A stronge education will get you far and sorry to say our public school system is not pushing our children far enough or hard enough.  I do think it is very possible to succeed with a public education but if you have the ability and option to better your children's future I do not see why you wouldn't.  I am not rich and we struggle every month but my daughter's future is what I focus on! 	
FALSE,"This argument is ridiculous and flawed for a number of reasons. Namely there is no ""one-size fits all"" formula for educating children. Every child is different and deserves the ability to seek the education that best suits their needs. Anything controlled by the government inevitably turns into a bureaucracy which is particularly damaging in education. You can not test every child on one set of specified guidelines. Secondly the quality of education a child receives is primarily the responsibility of the parents regardless of whether the child attends a private or public school. A dedicated parent can make sure the child receives a good education regardless of where they attend school. 	"
FALSE,"It's a really fascinating debate. how people are so quick to trample on the rights of others all the while saying ""for the children."" CS Lewis had you guys pegged. 	""Of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. Their very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be ‘cured’ against one’s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants imbeciles and domestic animals. ""	"
FALSE,I taught in public schools for 14 years but when we moved to another state and our church had a school we chose to send her there (and I also teach there) so she would better fit in socially at the church AND Jesus is the cornerstone of our school instead of being banned.  It's also great that we are not ruled by NCLB.  And our school calendar is not determined by tourist season at the beach as are the school calendars of both the states I have taught in.
FALSE,OMG....She's a Democrat!	
FALSE,This is a false premise.  The schools are messed up due to politics and not a lack of funds or participation.  If schools would take the politics out of the classrooms and just teach kids basic skills a lot of people would return.  Why on earth should I allow my precious child to be indoctrinated into liberal political non-sense and also be exposed to the misbehaving cretenous off-spring of liberal parents? 	
TRUE,This lady is something else.  First of all let me say my children attend a private school.  Our district schools are less than admirable.  Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood it is clear that our district schools have issues...financially and educationally.  I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it?  I'm not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools.  I'm still a citizen that pays taxes that go to my local school district...whether I agree with it or not!  Our district will be voting on a budget override for the third time this year.  The override has been cut down the past two attempts but they're urging citizens to vote yes....even though they just approved $150000 for the purchase of additional visitor bleachers at our local high school football field.  Really?  Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight like quality education not quantity education and not buying unneeded items like bleachers I'll consider sending my kids....wait nevermind!  No I won't! I'm proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon!
TRUE,Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues.  I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning. When I taught in NYC before NCLB students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even.  Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games and 1/2 the class did not speak English in the same class! Hence I switched to Private....So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue. We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference.
TRUE,"I went to public schools I thrived in public schools - my mom MADE me go to public schools.  I was even a public school high school teacher!  Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! Yes out public school system is broken but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools' job nothing is going to change.  And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and ""live to serve the public"" and don't want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators. So yes if you want a strong no bull parent supported child first customer service-based ""you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out"" educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded then you should send your child to a private school. This is what ALL schools should aspire to be.  And until America starts realizing that  education is a privilege that should be supported and respected where teachers are revered we are always going to have problems.  As the morality of our society crashes so too does the level of morality and level of education in our public schools. 	"
TRUE,A parent should make the right choice for their child that's good parenting. Many parents don't have time to deal with a bad public school system. The kids pay the price if you have other schooling options your kids are better off utilizlng them. 	
FALSE,hi	
FALSE,What if the public schools in your district are fantastic and you do contribute by paying school taxes and you still prefer to send your kids to private school?  What's Ms. Benedikt's response then? 	
TRUE,"Registered Independent provided us with Wikepedia as a source and provided this quote	""Students coming from a home school graduated college at a higher rate than their peers -- 66.7% compared to 57.5% -- and earned higher grade point averages along the way."""" ""	""But Rob Reich who teaches political science for Stanford University tells us why we know very little about the real effectiveness of home schooling""The main point I tried to make is that we know astonishingly little about the academic performance of children who are homeschooled. The sad truth about home schooling is that we have little more than glorified anecdotes. 	""For a quick overview first check out the comprehensive and detailed site maintained by Professor Robert Kunzman of Indiana University. Kunzman has written sympathically about homeschooling but he explains why the frequent claims that the “average homeschooler” outperforms public and private school students are unjustified. ""	""Why do we lack such evidence? The reason is related to the massively de-regulated environment for homeschoolers. Because existing regulations for home schooling are either so minimal or so little enforced many parents do not notify local educational officials when they decide to home school. At least ten states do not even require parents to register their home schools. ""	""A further concern is that an appalling amount of the research conducted on home schooling and given publicity in the media is undertaken by or sponsored by organizations whose explicit mission is to further the cause of home schooling. Of course that research is conducted by persons whose pay comes from organizations dedicated to promoting home schooling is no reason to reject the findings out of hand. """
TRUE,The problem is that Democrat/socialists run most public schools and continue that in higher education which is also failing our children. There is no hope there but why should we wait until something is done. By that time my kids will be retired! We keep hearing that public school is where your kids get their social skills to go into the real world. You are sure as hell right about that today; how to roll a joint how to talk on the phone; how to take it in the a$$! Great skills all. 	
TRUE,Maybe I missed it but does this writer have children?  Luckily we live in a good public school district and my step daughter does attend public school.  The public school she attends is #4 in the nation of public High Schools.  If we lived just a few miles down the road she would be in one of the worst school districts.  Parents should do what they feel is best for their children.  We rent in order to keep her in this district as we could never afford to purchase a home here.  We will put our dreams of owning a home on hold until she reaches College.  My sister and her husband worked two jobs in order to keep their kids in private school for the quality education.  When the kids transferred to Public High School they were leaps and bounds ahead of the other children in class.
TRUE,"How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent ""bad people""? Our liberal anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching. Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society. They instead use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles. And this author thinks we are ""bad people"" for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities? Give me a break! 	"
TRUE,This is nuts.  I went to a crappy high school.  this was 1970.  Nobody seemed to care what we did.  There were knife fights and drugs all over.  There was no guidance from any of the teachers and my guidance counselor was a joke.  He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it.  In the University I found out what they didn't teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year.  I graduated and went back and got an MBA.  When my kids got old enough for school I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work.  My kids both have nice professional jobs.  I pay my school taxes but public schools don't want my input just my money.
TRUE,Rich kids are not the only kids who go to private schools. My two kids went to private school and I worked extra to afford tuition. I would do it again. Many of the kids were on financial scholarships not vouchers. The school was a religious school which we were of the same belief and values as the school. Because I was able to send my kids to a private school I am a bad person. Why don't parents who desire to send their kids to private school work a little harder to improve their income instead of complaining and expecting this country to come down to their level. If I remember my economic class taxes pay for schools and all parents of private kids pay taxes. So we are paying twice for kids education;  private and public!!! 	
TRUE,I believe in discipline accountability and excellence.  These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything. The public school system the way it is now is not an option.  Plus I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution.  Nope public school not for me! 	
FALSE,Who says that the school system should be the only faucet to educate their are parents who stay at home with a college education most in education what makes them less educated than the teachers in the school system.  In fact it shows that kids who have more one on one time with an educator do better the school system cannot offer that to children where do I get that statistic by public school system who teaches my son with autism.  He needs a one on one with a teacher but the school system cannot pay for it. And do not say its because of those that are home schooled because those parents still pay taxes to the school.  This is a joke thanks to all those at home educators investing in the lives of their children. 	
TRUE,The private school parents pay for Public schools as well as childless parents pay.  The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly.  The unions are their main priorty not the child's education.  So I don't blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools 	
TRUE,The flaw.  The author assumes  parents can change a public system.  This is not so.  If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents..it is not it is to serve and teach the children.   As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class. The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system...not to parents.  This is where money talks if you want to make a change or have a say in your child's education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best (private school). 	
TRUE,As a product of private school and a spouse a product of public school... we decided to try public school for our kids.  It was not a great education to say the least.  I was the PTA president for 4 years chair of the ESSAC committee and involved in all supportive aspects.  Here's what I learned in Dade County FL. 1. there is no scaffolding learning in math.  they have loads of bench marks and your child never really masters what's important thus it doesn't build on itself.  The best countries in Math have like 4 benchmarks... master addition then subtraction etc. we have like 16. 2. they teach to the test (FCAT). my son had basically no science in 5th grade because it was not on the test.  schools get rewarded for scoring high. 3. my son's gifted class had no books just crappy copies.  the money was there they just chose not to do it.  when I offered to buy books and called the districts the next day the kids had books. 4. rhetoric politics beyond a parents control. 5. too many kids in a class 6. the UNION! 7. and I can keep going on. we put our eldest in a preparatory school and have never looked back.  the teachers are so incredibly happy well educated and are in it for the right reasons. my children absolutely love school and they don't emphasize a specific program - they put emphasis on all.  The public school system is full of money in the wrong places it's way top heavy and spent thousands of dollars buying things they threw out without even opening.  There's a lot of hand greasing and nepotism - I'm speaking for Florida.  If you can do it a good preparatory school is second to none.  My family could not be happier.
TRUE,Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools. Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school. As a matter of fact as a homeowner I am supporting both systems much more than those less fortunate can. I am all for the public school system.  I was a product of the public school system and yes they are very necessary.  I believe everyone deserves an education and much more than the 12 years we get but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children!
TRUE,The public school system is unable to adjust to the changing environment. Drop out rate has been increasing for years and we continue to fall behind the rest of the world. Fighting the local school board is fruitless. I will continue to put my money where it is best served by getting my son a private education. The system can suffer or change. 	
TRUE,The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole.  I am a loving knowledgeable intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life.  My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area.  Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school and me paying for BOTH types of education.  I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don't attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition.  I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child's education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children.  Public schools will never get better until they have competition.  It is time we stop rewarding a bad system and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition. 	
FALSE,Hey Ms. Benedikt why don't you go all the way and require all of those who live in the best school districts to take in families from the poorer school districts so that they too can experience a quality education?  Surely their homes are too big to just accommodate the needs of one family.  Equality for all.  Wouldn't this be a more fair solution? 	
FALSE,"Part of what seems ""failing in schools"" is that standards have been raised and no one is supposed to fall through the cracks anymore. Remember those old TV movies where guys in their 50's had actually faked their way through school and life and someone discovered they were ""illiterate?"" Can't happen. You will be found out and remediated if for no other reason than the school needed you to improve your test score. In such an environment it only takes one subgroup not improving for a whole school to be labeled failing. Many of you will have your stories of bad school experiences in this regard. But it is the whole picture not generalization from your legitimately bad experience that shows there has been improvement even if people pay more attention to the bad reports then the good just like we all care more about who shocked us at the VMA's rather than who actually showed some class. (ie N'Sync but I digress.) Yes there are schools where there is poor remedial programs and those schools are supposed to be targeted for government intervention. From all the press you'd think it was a high percentage of schools but it is not. Many of those districts also have a high transience rate and that makes it hard to keep improvement programs cohesive. But when you look at how schools are rated by states they actually are improving. Is there a long way to go	"" yes. But sometimes the school can only do so much and it becomes the parents job to enrich their children's intellect. It is  the whole environment not just the place where you send your kid 6.5 hours a day that makes your kid a learner. """
FALSE,Even though the religious right doesn't like it the fact is Thomas Jefferson was not a Christian but was a Deist. That is he believed in The Supreme Intelligence/God based on the application of his innate God-given reason on the laws and designs in Nature. Jefferson broke with tradition when he designed the University of Virginia without a chapel. Up to that time universities all had a church or chapel at their center. Jefferson's university had a library at its center. 	Progress! Bob Johnson	www.deism.com	
FALSE,What an idiot. Send your kid to a public school in Delaware and watch what happens.	
TRUE,My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school.  Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible.  We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible. When we moved to an areas with better schools we would go to public schools or magnet schools. We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life.  Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well.  Why?  Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools.  When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests. My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools.  Schools are not always bad because of funding etc.  Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers.  I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos.  They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge. Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification. 	
FALSE,The opposite logic could also be applied that only bad people inflict a crappy public school education on their children instead of sending them to a private or religious school where they will be able to overcome the lack of support these children have at home. 	
FALSE,What a BS! I will be an irresponsible parent if I do not do what is best for my son when I can afford to send him to best school available public or private.  Allison Benedikt is probably not a parent or is jealous of parents that can afford to send their kids to private school. 	
FALSE,Why are you asking random strangers on the internet to pass judgement on other peoples' personal choices?  Whose business is it? 	
FALSE,She is right.  We should not only support our public schools but be more involved!	
FALSE,"Who dresses this woman in the morning?  Because she most definitely does not have the where with all to do it on her own! AND... who would pay someone to write this kind of ""CRAP""? Has ""EVERYONE"" with ""ANY"" intelligence left MSN? 	"
TRUE,I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved. The more people leave the worse its going to become. The public school system lets them deal with real life too unfortunate that it may be but that is what's out there in college and the work force too. There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them. 	
TRUE,So in summary I should sacrifice my children for the good of the public school system as a whole?  That is like saying I should buy a house in a bad neighborhood because it would make the bad neighborhood better?  No thanks. 	
TRUE,"If I had school age childrenthey would not go to any public school.My future grandchildren will not go to public school. Why would anyone write an article sighting that parents are ""bad"" for choosing private over publiclet me guess probably a progressive liberal who feels that ALL children need to be indoctrinated with garbage and forced sexuality that is not age appropriate. Yes I took my son out of public school because I felt that the (lack of) education he was receiving was not up to standard. He was in 5th grade and his spelling words were the days of the weekand one of four native English speaker in his class. The teachers from my experience expect the students to teach themselves they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends(other staff)take care of personal business etc. Oh and now in Ca.add the confusion of gender identity to the mixwhere 98% of the students will be forced to accommodate less than 2% causing many to be afraid of using school restrooms because now all any student has to say is ""I feel like a boy/girl today so I want to use the opposite gender restroom today"" and now preteen/teen boy can just walk into a girls HS locker room/shower any time he wantseven while girls are showering. This article was nothing more than union propaganda because we all know how supportive unions are of non-union entities.One more thing at least a private school can FIRE a teacher for legitimate reasons ( molesting kids etc) unlike public schools who's teachers unions have PROTECTED those who have committed crimes against our children(ex. teacher feeding his semen to children on cookies)."
TRUE,The public schools are not going to get better. Being an involved parent with kids in public schools it doesn't matter what policies I try to bring about or suggestions I bring or SAFETY CONCERNS that I have made the schools and transportation departments aware of things will NOT change. When the average $$ amount spent on educating a child is around $12k and it costs $40k+ to house a prisoner then that is where one of the problems lies. And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to even better homeschool are not going to make a difference. There are MANY issues with how public education is formed and the parents sending their kids to private school are not going to make a difference. That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes.
TRUE,"Well this has been fun but I have to go back to work.	""remember keeping your kids away from knowledge that you don't like is a moral crime.""	Have a nice day.	"
TRUE,What a joke this is. If I could afford a private school (and if i had a kid) I'd send them in a heartbeat. Why send them to a public school that has behavior problems graffiti in the hallways rotten old classrooms with NO TEXTBOOKS FOR KIDS TO TAKE HOME classes of 40+ kids and no toilet paper?
TRUE,"What planet does this idiot live on?  Does she think that pouring money into the public schools is going to rid them of bullying gang violence and drug use?  It most assuredly is NOT.  And that's why my daughter elected to make the sacrifice and send her children to private school. Besides there's no denying that even the best public school system in the country cannot compete with the quality education kids get in a private school.  ""Nuff said. 	"
TRUE,If I had the money I would send my children to a private school.  The public schools should go back to teaching   children. they are now into food. and everything else but teaching.  try to get after school help in our local school and they tell you no.  some schools send you home if you have any team shirt other than the state or local teams shirt. lease out the food program and save us money. so many things are wrong with local school. go back to teaching. 	
FALSE,I may actually send my kids to a private school after reading this liberal trash.	
TRUE,Correction...worked hard and made sacrifices to afford PRIVATE school.	
FALSE,"Hmmmmmmmmm let me see if I understand this......If everyone had to drive a Dodge then Dodge would be better.  If everyone had to use Sprint for phone service then Sprint would be better.  If everyone ate dinner only at McDonalds then McDonalds would be better.  Just what I expected.  Let's embrace our lowest common denominator.  Striving for excellent is now out of vogue.  If you have any money you are considered worthless and selfish.  When our country is purchased and we are enslaved by high achievers maybe the population will finally understand that the ""progressives"" had it all wrong.  Surely our new rulers will be kind and gentle people who care about our feelings.  Our local prep school operates on only 55% of the student cost as the public school down the street.  Bureaucracies are inefficient especially when dealing in human capital.  God save us from these morons...please."
TRUE,If Mom and Dad feel they are equipped to home school their children so be it. But religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a kid devoid of a proper education. It's the same as denying a sick child medicine because it offends the parents religious beliefs. This is Poppycock! 	
TRUE,If you can afford to send your kids to private schools do. Most public schools especially those that are intercity are not good. My son went to Columbus Public Schools in Columbus Ohio and they treated him and myself badly. I was constantly in the school and very involved in his education. It made no difference. They didn't want my help or my commitment to the school.  I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement. I wish I had moved sooner but if I could have afforded private school my son would have gone. So in Columbus Ohio if you can't afford private school move to the suburbs. I also agree God should have never came out of the schools. 	
TRUE,"I say do the opposite of what that ignoramus Benedikt says and send all children to private schools with parents choosing the schools.  When someone becomes n the decision-making process from beginning to end then that can only improve the education system. All kids can ""afford"" private schooling since the money being spend in public schools belongs to the taxpayers and that money should be re-directed towards private schools via parental choices of schools.  That way any faiiing school or failing teacher can get the boot and the parents maintain control of the quality of the education that heir kids get.  That Benedikt is only interested in having government keep control over people's livesand in retaining union control of the school system and the funding from the taxpayers. 	"
TRUE,I've had my children in parochial school switched to public and now a charter school.  Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested.  We put all of our effort into making the system better joined every group volunteered at the school and all events.  Reality sunk in.  Very little changed with all our efforts. Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish.  So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children.  We aren't interested in whether you like it or not. Sometimes some of us are trying to make the world a better place starting with our children. 	
TRUE,This article is bogus! Most people put there kids in private schools because the public schools are teaching in a way that people do not like. Many public schools think they are gods and work on molding kids to be Progressives. Kids are being kicked out of public schools for pretending their hand is a gun etc. Bad article bogus article and the writer must be a progressive. The schools need to change not the parents. 	
TRUE,"The comment this girl made was	"" I hate all white people! I tried to get my grand-daughter out of that classroom but was refused. This girl was constantly in fights bullying someone stealing something in trouble all the time. She actually said she wanted to be kicked out of school. She didn't want to be there anyway.  The parents of these kids are NOT doing their job in bringing them up right. My grand-daughter knows many multi-racial kids and friends with all sleep-overs going to parties going to movies and even they have problems with these kids that bully steal fight and generally cause trouble.  Their families too are looking everywhere they can to put their kids into better schools. The public schools have delinquents going there. The normal kids do need to go to charter and/or private schools. """
TRUE,This is insane! private school is an option that doesn't come easy. shelling out 10000 dollars a year isn't easy! Privat schools can't be hated on. Its a huge privalege
TRUE,"I am a product of private school vs the rather run down public school around the corner from where I grew up. I later worked in an after school science program in public schools. I can attest that if I went to these schools I would not have been there to test these kids after school. The only way my parents could have fixed it as the author claims would have happened is if they quit their jobs and taught themselves. I lost all faith in our local public educators when I was repeatedly asked ""You're an engineer like on a train?"" and ""How do I hook this to the computer?"" (speaking about the cardboard pinhole camera we had made that day with the class with film) 	"
FALSE,Shes sounds like the kind of liberal hack i expect on this site. A child's degree of education is the purview of the parent. If I have the means to insure my children get a proper education then thats my choice. Also most schools got rid of vocational programs that are sorely needed . Not every kid can handle the material at college and to force them to try creates an economic burden on themselves and society. I would rather the child go learn engine repair or welding. Both of which tend to pay better then regular four degree jobs. 	
TRUE,"I have students in both private and public schools.  When I heard my daughter (in 8th grade at a public school) who has to work very hard to get slightly above avg. grades say ""the kids are such a distraction in the classroom and I can't concentrate/work.  And the teachers can't do anything about it."" That was all it took for me to send her to the private school where the learning environment is better and the teachers can do something about it. I don't disagree the author about the parents driving change but guess what?  When my daughter has a 4 year window in HS to succeed or not to succeed I don't have time to drive the change that typically take years."
TRUE,Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher's hands are tied by politically correct nonsense.  They cannot correct errors cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students assign homework or expect respect from the students. The inmates are running the asylum in many public schools. 	
TRUE,All I can say is WOW!!! What a load of BS. I never post on these things but today I had to. That's right I do not give a s**t about the public schools system I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school. What she will get is brainwashed to be a liberal zombie and grow up to write and believe stupid articles like this one. 	
TRUE,Public school is for everyone private school is for people who want to be seperated from the whole. These parents believe they will give an advantage to their children by getting the best education possible. What they forget is that education is only one part of creating a whole human being. Many of the comments are political some are biased but one must consider what education means. When you send your child to school it is to educate them on topics that as parents you may not know about or cannot communicate to them as well as a qualified teacher can. Those who misbehave in class have problems the teacher cannot help the child with mainly because they are not qualified psychologist or other professional. Let those parents keep throwing money into private schools that obviously do not completely produce a mature adult. Only parents can do this. Public schools need help for one very basic reason the majority of children go to public school. The young are the backbone of any country. The schism between rich and poor will increase. We all know how this story ends. 	
TRUE,"How is it possible for someone with an idea this moronic to actually have an article printed on a major news site.   It is the liberal mindset that there is no right or wrong that students cannot be disciplined in school and that teachers who perform badly cannot be fired that has destroyed the public education system in the first place.  To write an article that states that parents wanting their children to get a good education and are willing to sacrifice to pay for it are bad is absolutely ridiculous.  I have 5 children that all go to private school.  I don't own a car that has less than 190000 miles on it.  I don't go on vacations.   I don't have a 50"" TV and my mortgage payment was decided by what I can afford not by what the bank would lend me.   I have neighbors with pools in their yard driving Mercedes who go on cruises twice a year tell me they can't afford private school for their Kids.  Its a priority choice.  For me the education for my children is more important than the new car. The idea that I should sacrifice the education for my kids for the greater good of society as stated in the article is liberal (socialist) bunk. The fact that the article was printed at all shows the leanings of the media as a whole."
TRUE,"Adults have every right to make decisions for themselves for which they later suffer. . Consciously depriving a child of an adequate education solely because ""father knows best"" or thinks he does is tantamount to child abuse. 	""When it comes to medical care the courts often overrule parents who are irrationally threatening a child's life due to mistaken religious beliefs. If a teenager told doctors """"I want this treatment"""" and the parents refused to give consent what would a court do? An adequate education is vitally important in a child's life. Parents should not be allowed to withhold it. ""	"
TRUE,"Not all public schools suck but most do. Some teachers need to be fired some retired and some need to change vocations. Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now ""retirement safe"" this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood. Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school. For that under privileged family it's a blessing but for my family it was sad. The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one. *** The real solution to improve the education system is give every family with kids a voucher. The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school. At public it's payment in full at private it's payment in full or pay the difference. With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform! Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education. It's just like everything else the government has involvement with failure!! 	"
FALSE,"A question	"" When did Allison Benedikt join the Communist Party? Seriously when did Ms. Benedikt join the CPUSA? Parents who want the best for their children are bad people? This is precisely the argument Josef Stalin made during the Soviet holocaust-that-never-was in 1953 (a/k/a The Doctors' Plot). Too many Jews were giving their children privileged educations at the expense of the majority--and hence more deserving--GOYIM. Do I have the obligation to sacrifice MY children on the altar of the COLLECTIVE? Ms. Benedikt thinks so. I THINK NOT. """
TRUE,If I had the means to I would send my children to private school....	
TRUE,Okay if I had children now they would go to private school.  I am a police officer and work part time at a private school and the attitude there is totally different. The kids there are very respectful and so far no one asked about my gun.   If I go into a public school they ask about your gun and half the time while we are there we are arresting someone.  I encourage everybody I know to send their children to private school. 	
TRUE,"To the author of this so-called ""Report"" YOU CAN GO FLY A KITE!   Let me just say I went to Public schools growing up. My parents couldn't afford to put me through the Private System. When I got older I decided to go to a Private Christian college. I now manage International Business for one of the top performing companies in my industry.   For my children no way am I sending them to Public schools. Forget it......I will homeschool them before I do that. Public schools in my area are a joke. And with the direction that our country is headed I don't want idiots in public schools turning my kids into little rats with no ambition to do anything more than suck on the teet of the system and work for nothing with the drive to come home and do not more than play video games and ""Connect"" with their homies on facebook and Twitter. My kids are going to school to learn and will be raised and guided at home. Public schools are gov't funded daycare. Shame that I don't have a choice WHERE to allocate my tax dollars. I have to trust liers and thieves to allocate $$ to driving our once great nation into the pooper. 	"
TRUE,...After all it’s usually the parents who rise up to make changes to the system.. I rose up to make changes...rose up to my feet and walked my family the hell out of a corrupt unsafe government battle ground and into the Private Catholic school system. I wouldn't send my dog to public schools in Florida. 	
TRUE,I hardly think it makes you a bad person to want a better education for your kids. My sister and brother-in-law are not wealthy but they worked hard spent their money wisely and put three boys through private school. The results are two West Point graduates that are now an attorney and engineer and a Wake Forest graduate that is now a radiologist. Private schools are like private business they must deliver a superior product or fold. Public schools are like most other public institutions. Dumb down to accommodate and encourage average performance. 	
TRUE,Sent both my kids to private schools after trying public schools for a short time.  Public schools should try to copy the private schools then maybe they would improve.  It's not the money because parochial schools have far fewer funds than public schools and still do a better job. Parents who fork over a bundle for tuition in private schools are still paying school taxes to the public schools and your calling them bad.  Get real. 	
TRUE,The writer is very wrong. Worse than ever today. What causes schools to be less than good include of qualities or less of the teachers the miniature dictators the various laws compelling attendance and politicians behind and causing the laws. Also the various people voting the politicians in. The writer is one of the causes of badnesses in schools education and the world. The writer may be obviously jealous of people richer than the writer a believer a person is bad not agreeing with the writer and also one of the people causing a world which requires to strive upwards to be good along with the various schools. Private education is one of the answers toward upgrading school and education quality and causing children to be greater more intelligent and more creative and productive. It's also a topic pertaining to freedom of choice. The writer may resemble an abstract sponsor of dictatorships and where there are no or very little freedom of choice. The writer's in and writing in the wrong country. The writer can peddle the writer's mess abroad where there are welcomings of dissenters to freedom and authoritarianism. The writer has an answer more in a dictatorship and is not welcome to meddle with the affairs encouraging improvements of and toward great and greater things in the good young USA. 	
TRUE,"I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling. It went great as far as academics and learning. Then I was switched to public schooling in a ""better"" district and my grades went from A's to D's. It wasn't that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn't help it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who even obvious to a 7th grader HATED their jobs. Good parents do what is best for their children and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend. So I guess by the author's reasoning we're ALL ""good"" people."
TRUE,"One could just as readily argue that it's child abuse to put your children in public school around some of those children who are rude crass lazy disrespectful and dangerous and cannot be thrown out for outrageous and disgusting behavior because they have a ""right"" to an education they care nothing about. 	"
TRUE,I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home. Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school.    I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child. 	
FALSE,Her reasoning shows why people should 'Not' send their kids to public school!	
FALSE,"One major flaw in the argument of sending the child to the public school that ""stinks"" is that parents will move to another district that is a top performer.  In conclusion - They have left behind the non-performing district to go to a performing district.  I guess that makes them a bad parent too. 	"
TRUE,So what you are saying is that the problem with the school system in the United States is the parents of the children who attend the schools?  Your thinking is mind boggling.  The problem with the public schools is who is running them and how they have been run.  Adding caring parents is not going to change who runs the school and how they are run.  Mark it down.  Therefore your suggested efforts will not fix anything.  But then all the fine people who send their children to private schools will be equally burdened with the pain and suffering of the public school system.  You will be happy then right? 	
FALSE,"No it's doesn't make you a ""bad person"" if you don't send your kids to public school. What DOES make you a bad person is if you are a person who limits other people's access to alternatives to public school while sending your own children to private school. You know like President Obama and most other Washington DC Democrats do. 	"
TRUE,Competition is what makes anything better (or eliminates it). We have very good public universities and collages because they have always had to compete with private schools (like Harvard started by the pilgrims).  So sending your kids to private schools will do more than anything else you can do to improve the public schools. I am a veterinarian if my clients started to leave my practice in droves I can think of nothing else that would have as dramatic affect on how I run my practice. 	
TRUE,It's individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it's just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement. In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children. It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it's an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way. Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education they teach evolution they teach homosexuality generally at an early age and some even hold classes about  certain religions. Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools. Lastly every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too. It's been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools.   Sandy 	
FALSE,Maybe if your parents had sent you to a private school you wouldn't have written such a stupid artlcle.  I'll send my kids where I please thank you very much.  Take your socialist agenda somewhere else. 	
TRUE,Call me bad if you want but I sent my soon through 14 years in private schools and thank you Lord that I did.  Schools where I live and in my parish just would not have cut it.  He got a fabulous education and I had to struggle so if someone wants to call me bad please have at it.
TRUE,"This writer is way off the mark...I'm a bad parent because I sent my kids to a private Christian school?  I don't want the federal government to be responsible for teaching my children and I certainly do not want them to ""indoctrinate"" my children with liberal bias and anti-Christian-Judeo teachings not to mention a revised American History where textbooks devote chapters to Muslims and Islam and hardly anything to our Godly forefathers.  They have been pouring zillions of dollars into the public school system for years and look at it.  Parents should have the right to educate their children the way they see fit.  It isn't the governments responsibility...And btw our forefathers were educated in mostly private schools and I think history proves how well they did! 	"
TRUE,I am sorry I am a hardliner on this. If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level you are guilty of child abuse. You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential. 	All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old.
TRUE,The whole premise of this is flawed. People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education. The downturn in quality didn't start with people taking their kids out it had been going on slowly but surely for years. Lack of discipline turning teachers into babysitters banning prayer and the Ten Commandments and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster. They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error(s) of their ways. 	
FALSE,Then public school children should be able to attend private school and they would all be better educated. Vouchers would be the way to go for the students. 	
FALSE,Dumb-so you are supposed to sacrifice your child so a school can get better?  No thank you. Here's an idea make the school good first and then parents will send their kids there.  I picked an area to live in that has excellent public schools.  I didn't pick a place to live that has bad schools so I could make it better.  If an area wants to attract high performing students with supportive parents then spend time money and effort to make it the best school it can be.  If you build it the people will come.  If your school sucks parents aren't going to sacrifice their kids so they can help start a PTA programetc. 	
FALSE,A young boy was recently beat up by three of his classmates on the school bus and you think that you can make parents feel guilty for not wanting that for their children. 	
FALSE,This writer obviously doesn't know anything about the public school system.      She doesn't know how public schools are funded by what she writes if you don't send you're kids to school there you don't pay for it. That's not true public cost comes mainly from property taxes even if you don't have kids. If people followed her advice there would be massive over crowding in the public schools making it a lot worse for all kids.      Does she even live in the U.S. what a moron !!! 	
FALSE,Yea Right they would they would only get worse everyone would want more money and do less work not to mention the political end of it. NO THANKS 	
TRUE,What part of socialism doesn't  she understand.  I'm more inclined to think parents are bad sending their kdis to public schools.   Let freedom of choice prevail. 	
FALSE,Written by a person that has no concept of the world works. She feels that if I don't send my kids to public school I will not be involved doesn't she realize that either way I pay taxes to support public schools and therefore as a real person I am concerned about how my tax dollars are used. According to her logic since I don't have any family members in the military I wouldn't care about the defense budget or I'm not collecting welfare so who cares how the money goes out and any number of budgets. If she thinks her idea would solve the educational system she needs to grow up and open her eyes. Does she really think parents control the schools or are they controlled by the source of their funding? Actually sounds like her argument is a more supportive of using private schools where the parents can have more say in what happens because they're funding it. 	
FALSE,Parenting styles & decisions including where to send your children to school is a very subjective matter.  Saying that someone is a bad person for sending their children to private/parochial school is no different than someone telling me that I'm not a whole or complete woman because I have chosen not to have any children. Ridiculous. 	
FALSE,"Benedikt writes that if you can afford private school chances are your child will come from an environment that allows them to overcome “a perfectly crappy public school.” Honestly this sounds like sour grapes that some one can't afford to send their child to private school and had a chip on her shoulder against those who can. Every private school I've ever heard of offers scholarships for some students to attend so just because Susie down the street goes to one it doesn't mean that she has a privileged life that will allow her to thrive based on economics in her house.   This doesn't even begin to account for the quality of schools. WHY as a parent should I send my child to a terrible school if I have other options? Full disclaimer here - we have very few private schools in our area (all are religious) and our school district is actually pretty good. Even so parents can only influence the schools to a certain degree. I have a couple of friends who have transferred their children to different elementary schools because they encountered issues that were ""deal breakers"" to them and that the schools were unwilling to work with them on.   When you accept the responsibility of having and raising a child you accept the responsibility of doing your best for that child to help them thrive and succeed in the future. The education they receive is a large part of that and if private schools in your area are superior and you can manage a way for your kids to attend then you have every right to do what you feel is in their best interest. 	"
FALSE,Public school is no different than private schools. My son started in a private school then he went to public school then he was home schooled and lastly grades 9-12 he went back to public school. He graduated near the top of his class. Probably if publics schools would look at private schools as a role model then public schools would probably get better. Also I think a lot of public schools can wear uniforms because kids are allowed to wear what they want and this distracts from studies. A middle school in my area did this for 4 years. The students were black and white with less than 1% other races. The school performance was a lot better in the class room. Kids were not sent to the office to have their parents or guardian bring them some other clothes and there was no surprise as to who was wearing what to school. Best thing about it the stores that sold the clothing allowed for a trade back and the store but up a bargain basement where students could buy the buy clothing. This also where there sales items went. Mississippi has a program for non performing schools. These schools get put on probation and if they are performing to standards then they are closed and kids are giving vouchers to go to a school closer to them that are performers.
FALSE,They are YOUR kids. Send them anywhere you think is best. It takes decades of parental whining and working to improve a school system. Your kid needs a good education today. Pay no attention to the nitwit who wrote this drivel. 	
TRUE,I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means. Public schools are not influenced by parents that's hooey. Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments. Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum what happens in the classroom discipline or anything else. How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed. My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education attend mass daily be safe and learn. By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears. I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums. What experrience do you have dear? Bless your heart.
TRUE,But no one NO ONE with means shall endager their teens.  Or their toddlers so they are modelers after Kim Kardashin and the Kayne's of the world that grow up to deal drugs and not sing with that slur.  I sent mine to a school like fine wine and today as I say one out of grad school first job ain't no fool with 3k a week now take a peek second of 3 makes more you should see with an MD. Send them wherever that you can afford to make them bettter because if your waiting for state to be  great ing (sic) then I will still be here for the debating.... See you on the crack pipe with all the other public schoolers.  Now I would change if one thing else that is if they through out the real trash because they are filth  but that won't change and a weeks supension aint in range to keep the bad from good  as is what this moron thinks they should.  Long Fellow....
FALSE,Vouchers could help some inf home schooling isn't their thing. Only unions are against them and for good reason. Teachers who aren't doing their job will get canned 	
FALSE,Then tell Obama to send his girls to the DC public schools.	
TRUE,Even though the public school system in my area is good I chose to enroll my daughter in a private school because she needed a smaller classroom setting and more one-on-one time with a teacher.  Her father and I were going through a divorce when she started kindergarten and we both felt she would do better in a smaller class than having 20-25 odd other children vying for the teacher's attention.  She loves her teacher her grades are excellent and she has made a lot of friends both in her school and from the public schools.  So if this reasoning makes me a bad person in the eyes of the writer so be it.
TRUE,Liberal lean with putting the blame on people that wish to provide a better education for their children. I'm sure that if we did away with private schools the government would then fix all the problems wiht public education. NOT! Friggin idiots. 	
FALSE,...I wonder what the author thinks of parents who teach their kids at home?	
TRUE,Home schooling does not have to be the enemy but those who home school must be educated enough themselves to provide a good education for their children. If they are just reading a religious text and not studying math science history and the like then parents are doing a disservice to their children. If they are just going to stay at home and not engage in society then maybe they will do ok but they will not be able to compete in the larger society. Home schooling works when there are some standards. Parents can incorporate their religion into the mix. We need to work together on this instead of name calling. 	
TRUE,If  you want what is best for your child  you'll send them to a private school.  I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade.  Most would say not at the expense of my child and they would be right.  The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States.  This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits. Education is one.  I hope that the government doesn't make that impossible to.  Just look at public schools.  Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life?  You've got to be kidding.  No thanks.  If you don't believe that they are as bad as I think they are then you need only pay close attention when you're in a situation where young people might be talking or better yet when they are at a check out register.  You will soon understand the failings of the public school system.  The idea that I should consider a lower level of achievement  for my children so that the public schools MIGHT improve is ridiculous.  All that would accomplish is further reducing the number of properly educated young people.  Look at the world achievement rankings of our young people.  We are not number one in any single category.  We are a second rate nation when it comes to education and while were' at it we aren't exactly a shinning example of  exemplary medicine either.  It's just embarrassing to see what the United States is becoming.  I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss.  This is not the country of my youth.  An example on the news yesterday covers yet another area that we are suffering with terrible.  Honesty and morality in our youth.  Two young people went into a retail store of some sort.  The lock on the door was broken and the lights of the establishment were on.  So the two people walked in to do their shopping.  Once they were ready to pay for the items they wanted they realized no one seemed to be there.  So they left the cash on the counter including tax.  I was surprised they could actually calculate that.  Probably from a private school.  At any rate I do have a point to make.  The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing.  The store management even provided them with some sort of reward.  All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing.  That says something about our morals or ethics if you will. 	
FALSE,This is crazy! I send my three children to catholic school which saves my school district $27000 a year.  That money should be redistributed to the public school. I should be thanked not criticized.  If we want to help children we should have school vouchers and all parents could decide where to send their children.   Tracy M.
FALSE,"As for the complaint about overcrowding in a Georgia school district the problem with public education in Georgia is the right wing ""government is evil"" fanatics who will not support the schools with their tax money. But beyond that when you Souhern right wing religious fanatics fill the minds of your young with creationism and Bible based science they'll never compete in college must less in the wider world. There's a Georgia Congressman named Broun who is on record as believing that Evolution and the Big Bang theory of the universe are ""lies straight from the pit of hell."" That is ignorance on a level beyond imagining. But that's what you teach your children.  Too bad you lost the Civil War. The country would be much better off today without you ignorant right wing religious fanatics. I just feel sorry for your children. 	"
TRUE,People who send their children to a private school are not “bad” people. They want the best for their kids! I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids. The children in the private system are polite listen to what you are telling them and responsive. Why because their parents pay for them to be there. They have something to lose if they act a fool. The children in the public system some not all are just waiting to get out at the end of the day. The parents think of school as a free baby sitter. I have had parents tell me I gave birth my job is over it is your (mine the teachers ect) to raise and educate these kids. It stems from children having kids forcing them off on the grandparents and the children thinking that they mother is there sister. In six years of going into schools to talk to children I have only been hit once. A fourth grader in the public system punched me in the back. He got sent to the office and was out in 10 minutes as he walked by me he smiled and said “I knew I could get away with punching an adult”. They did nothing to him just said “Do not do that”. The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children. They have to keep the numbers up to keep the funds rolling in. The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent’s sign that the children can be disciplined. I have seen a few schools that if the form is not signed they tell you that there school might not be right for you. This is because they want the children to know there is a price for acting up. I have seen in the public system where a principal would give candy to the children that act up to not do it again. This fool was reinforcing bad behavior. This is the caliber of people we have in some schools in the public system. I have a three year old and if I have to take a second or third job she will be going to a private school.
TRUE,Lets find out why parents choose certain private schools......1- less kids in the classroom with opportunity to receive education more to a one on one basis. 2- No nonsense attitude. You do work you are compensated with words of praise. You don't mom and dad will know about it and will expect parents' input and help. 3. Push for RESPECT RESPECT RESPECT.....the child is the student....the teacher is the instructor...PERIOD. 4- The teacher excels in helping children with disabilities...offers  help for children with extra needs......want me to keep going?  Now if I take my child to a Public school she will be out of high school by the time the system changes......y child will loose...do I want this?
TRUE,I do not think the public schools modify their operations or plans quickly enough.  Private schools do that or the tuition money dries up.  In the past Unions protected crummy teachers not only from being fired but from criticism that would have netted an improvement in teaching or at least sufficiently obvious reasons for the teacher to get a new gig.  This is changing but too slowly.  Private schools fire bad teachers with a quickness but are still tolerable of the faculty member who has a bad day or a bad week.  Both will close ranks to help out a teacher who could use a hand.  Public schools are more democratic private schools are fascist.  Public schools must accept all people (but not all behaviors and it takes a while to remove problem students) whereas private schools get to choose their students.  Private schools tend to be smaller and the teachers have more interaction with the kids which allows for a sense of unity to develop.  Public schools tend towards obesity - they are too large for their own good and for the good of the students - trimming the schools down to under four hundred kids would be better.  Stop zoning kids out of schools where some kids end up in money-dominated demographics and other kids end up in poverty-dominated demographics.  And above all give me more hours in the day to call and email and communicate with parents and civic groups. 	
TRUE,I wernt 2 a pubelick skool all uf ma lief. I turnd owt fein.
TRUE,I don't buy it. The bad schools are bad because of things that take too long to correct - longer then the period of time my kid will be in the school. Life is short. Kids grow up fast. They don't have this time to waste. More power to those that choose not to subject their kids to the socialist and enviro-wacko indoctrination being served up by the teachers unions and school boards 	
FALSE,Somebody sounds a little bitter their kids school sucks don't put it on the rest of us who do whatever we have to to put out kids education first. It all boils down to priorities I don't go have my nails done or out to eat weekly or waist money on entertainment if you have a problem with the public school system YOU do something about it. 	
FALSE,WRONG - NO !! Perhaps bad psychology bad child rearing perhaps. They are paying for the public schools its called  TAXES!! 	
TRUE,"The woman is an idiot. We live in an unaccredited school district fraught w crime and misdeeds. We are required to live within the city limits bc my husband is in lawenforcement and employed by the city. We will scrimp and sacrifice to send our 4 boys (4 years old and under) to private school or I will homeschool them before we send them to the crime infested schools with future ""clients"" of my husbands!"
TRUE,"My kiddos go to public school we can't afford private. I HATE the local elementary and I have tried my darndest to be my child's advocate taking control of teaching studying and overseeing issues that arise amongst peers. I am far form the only parent to feel that our school in particular has gone downhill for years. Schools feel like their hands are tied with difficult children (I am more so focusing on the behavior challenged kids) and therefore they run amuck causing chaos	"" cursing at teachers starting physical fights disrupting learning etc. Those parents defend and point fingers and the teachers are EXHAUSTED and just don't try anymore. So they give up on my kid who DESERVES so much better! """
TRUE,"Computers and home schooling can meld. Rosetta Stone is way better than ""Class repeat after me..."" 	"
FALSE,I have a friend who has send her children to private school but will no longer be able to afford it after this year. They are so concerned about the public schools that they are willing to move in order to get the best school district possible. I think the author of the article is in denial.  First these parents can absolutely do as they wish. Second just because you send your kids to these schools and advocate because you have money doesn't mean the schools are going to change. The author makes it sound like the current parents don't give a damn about their children or their education which is dead wrong. Some parents yes but not all. And that is just an insult to those parents who are already fighting to try to get their children a better education in the public schools. The school system across the board sucks. If we get rid of the teachers unions and model the schools after what has been proven to work then we may be able to work our way back to the top of the education ladder against other countries. I've been a teacher. I've seen some of the worst teachers in the world who have tenure. Who the crap came up with the idea of tenure in the first place? It's stupid! A job for life even if you suck like hell and do irreparable damage to kids because you treat them like poop. We fail our children every day that we send them to school in America. 	
TRUE,People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools. These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars.  By helping pay for it but not sending their children there they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student. 	
FALSE,I understand yet its a choice which as parents we have the freedom to choose where we want our children to be educated It doesn;t make them bad and it doesn't make a parent who's child attends public school any less as long as the children are learning and growing into productive people should it matter? Be grateful for what you have Some of our greatest gifts we have is our abilities to look learn listen attentatively and show respect  to read write and comprehend it to know show and see these realities are precious to the wise so teach the children everyday so that they can build a better future for generations to come. Peace! 	
TRUE,Having sent my children to both public and private schools I prefer private schools.  They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence.  Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence. 	
TRUE,SUPPORT MY LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL GUESS WHAT MY TAXES DO THAT FOR ME  WITH OUT ASKING !! There was a time we were okay to put our children in public school. That time no longer exists !! Not even based on the fact that what is there teaching our kids aren't worth discussing (The good ole saying of those who can do and those who can't TEACH)!  TRY THINKING OF THE SECURITY ISSUES WE HAVE!! The teachers have the right to misuse and abuse the system and our children anyway they want and get away with it because of the F*** teachers union.  We have shooters walking in every year most are students sick and damn tired of the abuse they get  from the school itself ! NOT THAT IT MAKES IT RIGHT FOR WHAT THEY DID OR GIVES AN EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY DO!!  But the argument is based on public or private. I'm not saying that it can't happen in a private school setting but I do feel safer having my children in that setting over public. The abuse from other children that we sit and hear about until one child has taken his or her own life because the school has refused to do anything about the bullying even though they have a 0 tolerance rule!! Truth of the matter is I wouldn't want to teach in a public school either!  The kids who are in the schools with no one at home teaching right from wrong. No manners moralsrespect for others!! No one to set higher grounds for them. Don't let them fool you though!! The private schools have dumb their education and standards down so much they are not much better however there is still a difference. My kids come home happy from school they get up in the mornings typical kids moaning and groaning about having to get up early but they don't fear going. They don't sit in class with gangsters and Liberal  Obama voting teachers forcing them to learn their way or no way!  They are given rights to make choices and argue points and think for themselves. They can God Bless someone from a sneeze or hug a friend without it being rape! We can put up Christmas Trees and celebrate things with out worrying about being sued. Parents are welcome to be apart of the system instead of it being hidden from us. We have a peace of mind when pulling away from dropping our kids off knowing they are going to be okay!
TRUE,This writer has nothing better else to do. Free speech is your 1st amendment right-say what you want but since this is your opinion and an you opinion is like well you know and you aren't financially responsible for everyone in the world nor are you raising everyone's kids some opinions best kept to themselves. Does she have a solution to fixing the crooked teacher problem or any other problems facing the individual communities in this area? Nope certainly not. Offer solutions to the problems and not judgement papers. Seriously if you don't have the time to fix the public school system but have the money to send your child to a better school why wouldn't you send your child the better school? That makes for crappy parenting if you ask me you are doing your kid wrong and missing out on opportunities simply because you support the public school system.
TRUE,SO IF YOUR SYSTEM IS MARGINAL AT BEST AND FAILING AT WORST --THE SENDING OF YOUR KID TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL IS CHILD ABUSE. WHY WOULD ANY WANT THEIR NOT TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS -EVEN AS THEY PAY THE DOUBLE COST [ THEY STILL PAY TAXES THAT SUPPORT THE PUBLICS ] --SEEMS LIKE THES PROGRESSIVE LIBS WOULD WANT AS MANY AS POSSIBLE TO GO PRIVATE FROM THAT STANCE ALONE. THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT THE TEACHERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOBS AS THEY CAN. TOO MANY UNION RULES AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS WITH THE TOO MANY REGS .  BENEDICK IS ONE OF THOSE THAT CAN'T STAND COMPETION AND THE FACT THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL PREPARE THE KIDS FAR BETTER THAN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT A FAR LESS COST [ NO EXORBITANT HEALTHCARE OR PENSION BENEFITS AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE ].  SHE MUST COME FROM THE TEACHERS DON'T HAVE TO ANY NOR DO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO EARN THE MONEY THEY THIEVE FROM THE TAXES --IN OTHER WORDS SHE THINKS WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT ANY FROM THE TEACHERS IF THIS IS THE CASE LETS DO AWAY WITH ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SAVE THE MONEY AND AGGRAVATION OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH CORRUPT UNIONS AND THE OFFICIALS THEY PUT IN OFFICE THAT GRANTED THEM THEIR GOLDEN PARACHUTE JOBS. MONEY HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER NOT TO BE THE SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE OF A QUALITY EDUCATION. WHAT EVER THIS AUTHOR IS DOING IF JUDGING BY THIS SHE IS INCOMPETENT AND SHOULD BE FIRED. 	
TRUE,It's wrong to send your kids to public school! YOU have no control over what's taught to them and you have no clue what's going on there. I would NEVER send my kids to public school. NEVER. Home Schools have done such a fabulous job of actually teaching kids and the parents are INVOLVED. Key word there INVOLVED. Home school rocks and public school is just another way for the government to influence your child. DON'T DO IT!!!!! 	
TRUE,This idea of hers that wealthy people send their kids to private schools shows just how little she knows. We put four kids through private school on a truck drivers salary while my wife stayed home to be there for them when they needed her to. It wouldn't matter how much money was pumped into the public school system it would still be a mess. Last time I checked this was still a free country meaning we are free to send our children to school where we choose. Free from the control of a ever increasing too powerful federal goverment . PS Hey NSA keep this under file if you like. 	
FALSE,America is all about freedom of choice right? I think its the parents choice to  send their kid to whatever school they feel their child will greatly benefit. Beside I think the parent are the first provider of what their child is learning and how by the way they are taught at home. This put all and I mean all parents in the driver seat to make sure their child or children are given the type of education they desired. I think that we should work to see that College education isn't a run away expensive school so anyone who wants to go to college can effort it. That the part the writer should be concern about. I think we are very lucky to the type of education that is offer here in America and the choice are endlessly so whether its private public or other type of school we have much to offer our children. Enjoy learning with your child. 	
FALSE,Your WONG WONG.	
TRUE,Then I think we should take all private transportation away.  If people were not allowed to have cars then the public transportation system would be better.  By letting people own automobile bicycles motorcycles etc. we are doing a great disservice to the public transportation system.    Another person that has the dream of a utopian society through socialist radical transformation.  Let just take all the competition away so we are never aware of how poor the education our kids are receiving.  Lets make it even more corrupt and easier for the government to waste money and use the media to lie to us that our children are getting great education and how efficient our tax dollars are working.    Where does this crap end.  Competition in schools (public vs. private) in business in healthcare keeps everyone a little more honest.  It creates efficiency innovation and makes progress take place naturally.  If you are the only game in town then you get to gouge keep your crappy product or service the same because your the only one supplying it.    In Kentucky the very worst school system in the United States our children read at a 5th grade level (maybe) as graduating seniors.  The waste corruption fraud and inside deals makes the mafia look honest.  They now want to create public boarding schools so that parents do not influence the child's learning experience in a poor or damaging way.  The school board believes it is the parents keeping children from making progress.  Last year in order to show improvement in our children testing scores they decided to grade on a curve and to remove difficult content.  It was necessary to do this in order to keep from disenfranchising students with lower scores.  The belief is that poor little Johnny only got 2 out of a 100 questions correct and the psychological damage it is doing to him when compared to other students that got 80 out of a 100 correct was just cruel.  They are no longer teach cursive writing spelling and soon math because computers take care of the spelling and calculations needed.  So all our children need to learn is how to use a condom get federal assistance and some altered facts of history.    Lastly and you will not believe me but in Jefferson County Public Schools they gave all the 5th grade children a handout say the Martin Luther King invented Christmas.  I kid you not I have a copy of the handout that was given to my child.
TRUE,Get your children the best education you can like a good parent.. If schools have really been dumbed down to accommodate 'born on welfare' demos  non public school;s are the best for them. 	
FALSE,"This is the same idiot who wrote about how burdensome her dog is & how much less she loves him since she squeezed out 3 kids (who at the time of the blog were all under the age of 4).  She's a MORON.  A self-indulged obnoxious twit who has little understanding of life in general.  So you turned out ""OK""  good for you.  Not every kid is that lucky & parents who put ""the greater good"" above that of their own children are bad parents.  There is no reason a parent can't send their kid to private school and help improve the public school in their district either by volunteering or being on the school board.  It's likely that all of the people she knows who send their kids to private school are bad people but that's probably because she surrounds herself with jerks (a reflection on her).  I personally know some very good people and parents who send their kids to private school."
TRUE,The premise of her argument is valid; however I don't agree entirely. She also takes it to a level that it need not be insulting and disrespectful to those that choose to do otherwise. I too went to private (Catholic) school as do my daughters it is our choice. Our public school district is an award winning one with many distinctions but I wanted my daughters to as I did be enveloped not only with a good academic environment but live the faith and that ultimately they as adults would make their personal choices how they wanted to carry out their lives that is the least I can do as their mom. To the point about not contributing to the public schools is a farce if you are a home owner you pay taxes property/school/etc etc right so actually those that choose to send their children to private schools are pay twice or three times over than the average school age family. 	
TRUE,I have five Daughters and they all went to private schools and everyone of them have a degree and now have good paying jobs. Private schools get students ready for collage and they are given lots of attention.   MMVSG 	
TRUE,There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse.	Regular testing should be required and if they fail it's back to public school.	
TRUE,As soon as the public education system brings back religion and disipline in the schools more parents will reconsider putting their children back in public schools. Until then I want my children in a safe religious setting where teachers can actually teach and not just babysit. The kids know that the teachers are no longer in control and they can pretty much do as they please.The teachers are seldom able to do what they were trained to do which is to teach. Solution #1- Make parents realize that it is their responsibility to teach their children respect and disipline. It is not the school systems job. Their job is to teach.   Solution #2- Bring back spanking and other forms of disipline with parental permission. Until students realize that they have to be responsible for their actions  it is unlikely that the environment will improve.   Solution #3- Bring back religious freedom in all schools. Our country was foundeed on this principle but it was removed because a small percentage of the American people objected. If we could have a national vote on religion in schools there is no doubt that a large majority would vote to bring religion back into the schools.   Solution #4- Consider teaching ROTC in more  junior and high schools for both boys and girls. This will teach them additional dicipline pride and respect as they grow into adulthood. Solution #5- Limit the power that the teachers unions have over their members as it relates to voting practices. Vote for what is good for the students and not feel oblgated to vote a certain way just becuase the unions say so.
TRUE,An article pointing out the problems inherent in home schooling will always attract comments from home schoolers who say it's the greatest thing. 	Some make money off the movement--like Mike Farris out in Loudoun County--others just want to rationalize the fact that they treat their children as intellectual slaves. 	
TRUE,Lady you need to get your head out of your *ss. There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school and guess what they are none of your business but here are a few. People generally do this because they want what is best for their children. For example religion is a good thing...the public school does not believe in that.....Christmas is usually referred to as the 'Winter Festival.' Additionally I don't want my child indoctrinated with leftist liberal crap. The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child's education. By the way last time I checked we are not in Cuba. 	
FALSE,I went to public school and it was rated the best in California at the time.  My son went to parochial school because the school system we lived in was not good.  But since we were not Catholic he had to take a 4 hour test.  He got in and I paid $40 a month at that time it was a lot of money 1970's.  Can you imagine what it was like to take that test at 5.  I paid taxes just like everyone else during this time.  When he went to high school I moved to Oklahoma so he could attend a public high school in the country I couldn't afford to send him to parochial high school cost to much but I knew he would get a better one on one in a small town and he did.  He went on to college finished in four years which many don't do. I was a single parent and they give odds that single parent kids don't go to college well mine did and finished. He has a good job and a family now and is debating on sending his kids to private school.  I would do it again.  This is America we all have a chose where we want to send our kids some public schools are great but if you can and want to send them to private why not.
TRUE,Truth be known she probably can't afford private school or dolesn't want to put in the effort for an excellent education. 	
FALSE,Firmly believe that Josh's parents can inculcate him with belief in the Great Pumpkin that the colour purple keeps away cooties or anything else they want. However if they decided pumpkin pulp was the food of life and denied him access to fruit veg meat  milk and other dietary necessities the state would rightly step in for denying him the necessities of life. Same with schooling. Period No argument. 	
FALSE,Just another socialist liberal trying to take from the working class so their kid can get something for free without them having to work for it. 	
FALSE,I do not think that will makes much difference if your public school  is performing at your expectations. When children are small and get expose to language and questionable  behaviors you will like to protect them by sending them to a more structural environment After I think that with home support guidance and clear communication of expectation they  should do well in any school if the public school continue performing to the higher standards 	
FALSE,"Here's the deal	""  Private school teachers are not union employees and do not receive government funds.   Public schools are staffed by union employees and get their money from taxpayers to be pissed away by union school superintendents. If you don't have a decent private school parents look for another private school to take their kids.   If you don't have a decent public school Obama takes MORE taxpayer money to piss away on weenie wussy programs that make public school into little more than government funded day cares. """
FALSE,Parents that can afford it it is their choice and no one has the right to say no!  The reason anyone would say they should send their kids to public schools is because they are jealous 	
TRUE,If I am a bad person for sending my child to private school well you are just plain dumb to think that.  I am not wealthy but I have changed my lifestyle to afford for my child to go to private school.  My child is allowed to pray in school unlike public schools.  This writer needs to visit a public high school in my area (and you may want to wear a bullet proof vest for your safety) and maybe she will reconsider her article. 	
FALSE,So just because someone has money that means they have the character to make something better? How about mind your own business and let people choose what they want to do without making them feel guilty for having options...you know like a bad person would do. 	
FALSE,One of the reasons parents send their kids is that they feel that their kids  are easily influenced by other kids.      If most kids in a bad school come from families who do donot give them proper guidance and discipline then why would a parent who is doing the right thing have their kids exposed to the bad influence? 	
FALSE,There is also online schooling.  My brother's granddaughter did very well the year she took it. No teachers to snoop through her purse and her lunch and subjects she needed not what the public schools offer.  When she went back to public school the next year her grades plummeted and my brother went ballistic when her teacher removed some food from her lunch bag saying it was bad for her.  Her lunch that day consisted of a turkey sandwich an orange a small bottle of something like Propel water( I don't remember what he told me about that) and an oatmeal cookie.  The teacher removed the cookie and the water.  Since when does a teacher have the right to do this? 	
FALSE,"The whole article is ridiculous. This is a slap to the face of public education. The writer implies that all or most public schools are ""crappy."" Parents ought to have a right to choose to send their children to a private school if they wish - there is nothing wrong w2ith that. And most parents that send their children to public schools are satisfied with their choice as well."
FALSE,"The comments are more fascinating than the article. Many folks some of them with impressive intellectual accomplishments would have us believe that the current era is different that we especially in the industrialized world have moved beyond superstition into truly rational ways of thinking. The comments prove quite the opposite. Many people firmly believe things obviously at odds with reality. In particular many are willing to ignore several centuries of improvements in organized education in our part of the world. 	""In addition many people refuse to accept that we can do things as a group """"society"""" that is that we can't do as individuals. This does not bode well for our future since in a very real sense we are all stuck with each other. ""	"
TRUE,My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did! He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character! I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures. In public school the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions! 	
FALSE,the  1st amendment.
FALSE,Knowledge of self is the greatest education any parent can give their child Home should stand as the best learning institution for your children it begins there first people should never totally rely on public or private schools to educate their children alone an old phrase is that it takes a village to raise a child I think public and private schools are useful some more than the other yet parents are the lead guidance for their offspring what better give can a father give his sun than the understanding of the heavens above I didn't learn that in school. 	
FALSE,"We home schooled our kids and they are now in nationally acredited virtual school systems. We moved to an area that was supposed to have a ""good"" school district. however when they found unhealthy levels of mold and dust mites in their kindergaten classrooms the administration handled it so poorly that I completely lost faith in thier ability to not only educate my kids but the look out for their well being while they were in school. We did get involved but we were the one's that had the state health inspectors come in and force the administrations hand. Had we not done that they would have done nothing. As it stands they ""cleaned up"" the issue but never found the source of the mold. When I asked how they would ensure it would not come back they just threw up their hands and said they cleaned it up. 2 years later we saw the Kindergarten teacher and she was displaying alergy symptoms just like 2 years before when they found the issue.   So their badness led to my badness and my kids are still well adjusted and well educated."
TRUE,"I went to a private school K-5th grade and was enrolled in public school starting in the 6th grade. I tested at the 9th grade level when I went into our public schools in 6th grade. Yes private schools give you a better education. However my social skills were seriously lacking from being in a small private school. Public school was by far the best thing my parents did for me in that regard. The ""everyday"" social skills I learned in public school were worth just as much as my private school education in my mind. I dont think I would have been the person I am today with out a mix of both."
FALSE,Home schooling and religious exemption are two different things in Virginia. HS requires some demonstration of a curriculum. RE is a total abandonment of any kind of instruction. 	
FALSE,It is the parents choice and we should empower all parents/guardians to allocate limited resources as they see fit via school choice vouchers.  How do you choose a restaurant how do you choose a movie how do you choose a home how do you choose a car?  Voluntary-exchange and if we desire better education it should be no different.  Where do you get the best customer service TGIF or DMV? Not to mention how school choice vouchers would monumentally empower the economically disadvantaged. 	
TRUE,The writer is an idiot. As a responsible rational moral human being I have a hierarchy of responsibility. I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family. My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society. This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings. Ergo if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district you're damn right I'm going to put them in a private school if I'm able to do it. I'm not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point. 	
TRUE,My daughter was in the public school system from 1st to 9th grade. I put her in the Cyber Academy in the 10th grade. It doesn't take as long to take the classes and do the course work. Most parents could do this with their kids after work if need be and I know plenty who do. In GA you have to take the GA standardized tests and prove your child is getting an education. You must also register your child's curriculum with the state so they know what you are using. Most state's homeschooling isn't as wide open at VA's program. Our homeschooling association has lots of outings and opportunities for kids to socialize. We have a homeschool band a choir an orchestra opportunites our our local state park in the junior ranger program. The idea being perpetrated by most media is that all homeschool kids are kids who never leave the house and are indoctrinated every day. Not true. Since school doesn't take as long kids have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of options that would not be available to them in an ordinary school setting. With the Cyber School - they are getting the state education - it's considered just another public school - but some kids do better with that environment that in the public school setting with all the bullying and general meaness that goes on there. Plus the teachers have too many students to care about them individually. My daughter has received more individuallized attention with the cyberschool than the phyiscal brick and mortar school.
TRUE,"I am in no way ""Wealthy"" however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background.  Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor.  I am involved as a parent why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system.  And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit. The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more.  They could do this at public schools but do not. So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts.  Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means.  Where there is a will there is a way.  There are grants that can be available too.  If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different. 	"
TRUE,what a bunch of hogwash...dekalb county schoold district in jacked up georgia is not worth pigs poop...as a matter of fact almost all public schools in dekalb county is lower than whale dung.... teachers dont care....  I am all for Private Schools.  I will never let my kids go to public school unless the teachers can prove they can teach.   Teachers pay should be based on performance.  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SUCKS......  BUNCH OF INEPT SCHOOL TEACHERS.....   Georgia school system really sucks poop.... 	
TRUE,I went to public schools in the 70s and 80's.  At that time our public schools were racially mixed.  While there were some problems we all learned that we have to live and work with one another.  You don't see schools like that nowadays. Schools today are more intergrated than ever.   I think it's very sad.  If more middle class people would send their kids to public schools the schools would greatly improve.  However it's going to take a large enough group of people doing this in order make it work. Tossing one or two kids into an a low performing school isn't going to do anyone any good.  If all the arm chair liberals in the suburbs would get out and practice what they preach the world could be a much better place.
FALSE,"@Allison Benedikt 	""  If you willingly send your child to a bad school that makes you a bad person. """
TRUE,I guess it must be true that the author of the article was a result of a public school who could barely build up any compelling arguments for the topic of her choice. Unfortunately I want my kids to avoid to be a such result. 	
TRUE,My 10 year old is in a private school. This will be her second year. In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade. And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her. This was a small town in Texas. No more will she ever go to a public school again. I'm not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she's not Mexican. Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn't speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something. NO! Not having it......    So you can judge and tell me I'm wrong but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools. I know it sounds wrong but that's the way it is...
TRUE,"The writer overlooks the biggest problems facing our schools today . They are under control of two evil entities with agendas that favor themselves not our children The first group is the Federal Government via the Department of Education which takes control out of the hands of the local school districts and sets rules and agendas disguised as ciriiculum -example is Common Core-. The second group - the teacher unions that put the interests of the union leaders and the members ahead of the students. The parents who are able to make use of private schools are still forced to support public education with tax dollars even though they get no benefits in return.The public school system has become the modern day worst case scenario of ""taxation without representation"". 	"
FALSE,We already spend FAR more per student then any nation in the world. The problem is that the school system is run poorly (government) and that there is a distinct lack of focus on education among some cultures.     This writer is an idiot. 	
TRUE,"Young Mr. Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling. No matter how well intentioned few parents have the education time and skills needed to teach. Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools demanding better performance and. outcome and be willing to support the much needed 	funding.	But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion. 	""The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch dug by those who despise authority (Nobody tells me what to do) see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow behind every bush and in anything that will require them to think before they vote. ""	Befuddled wishful thinking rules.	"
TRUE,The writer is so Wrong we could invest all the money in the world in to Public school and the fact is you still won't be able to say a prayer before class still won't be aloud to sing Christmas song that have the name CHRIST in it & we still would not be aloud to put a cross up in the class room BECAUSE it's PUBLIC SCHOOL can't offend anyone!   My children go to private school for more then an education but to also be closer to god which they can't aren't aloud to do in Public school. 	
TRUE,Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET's like every other property owner. Public schools want a monopoly. For years they nearly had one the result the sad shape of our public school system. Unions DO NOT like competition (try walking across a strike line you SCAB). The problem is without competition the product becomes stale and innovation disappears. It's human nature. Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools government and anything else unions monopolize. Human nature makes the final result of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment stagnation for the simple lack of incentive. 	
TRUE,If I had the money wealthy or not I'd send my kids to a private school.  That way I'd ensure they would have a quality moral based education not this liberal B...S... the public schools ram down kids throats today.  Unfortunately I have been unemployed for some time now and buying food for my kids is a higher priority.   Making the asinine statement that sending all kids to a public school will make the schools better is the result of someone who has gone to public school and is a complete idiot. 	
FALSE,Her reasoning is equal to a dog turd.  Apparently the writer is unaware that if the wealthy own property the most likely already support   public schools which would mean they are paying for 2 educations per child. Also by defualt  she seems to be  stating that the parents that presently  have children in public schools do not care about their childrens education so it's up to the wealthy to do it.
TRUE,"You miss the point entirely lady. For example	"" 1. Its not OK to entirely have taken God out of schools. 2.People don't want their children indoctrinated with leftist crap. 3.

FALSE,Wow try sending your kid to public school in Los Angeles oh yeah and I guess you have no religious values too you were so high when you wrote this. 	
FALSE,"I find nothing ""compelling"" about this authors argument.  We have 5 children and 16 grandchildren who have been home schooled and have gone to charter schools.  We believe in Choice and Agency and all were given the opportunity to attend regular public schools.  We have some of the best public schools in our area of northern Calif.  A few of the children opted for that option were loved by teachers who gushed at their responsibility their intellect their respectful attitudes towards everyone.  Every one of those children opted for returning to charter and home school after experiencing overcrowded classrooms raunchy behavior and language and 7 to 8 hour days in dumb downed classes.    ""The proof is in the pudding!""   Our children and grandchildren graduated from high school at 13 14 and 15 years old.  They were at the top 1% of their peers in testing.  The ones old enough to go on  to college have received straight A's the oldest have their own businesses.  In our family meetings and dinners  (28 of us)  their comments about 4 hour school days filled with exploration about our world brings great comfort to my wife and I.  No PC crap just plain goodness kindness understanding about the good and bad in this world all stemming from our family personal moral religious and political perspectives.  This article as well as many on MSN lack substance lack a grasp of reality and our at best naive.  Now I am off to give three of our grandchildren their weekly tennis lessons."
TRUE,With a plethora of drugs and gang problems public schools are the LAST place I would send my child!  No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems. We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people.  They have a 100% college acceptance rate!  That's unheard of in public schools.  So you won't get your undies in a bunch the young people graduating from this school are from accross the race spectrum.  I'm talking black white brown asian oriental you name it they've got it. All you commies out there can shove it right up your A$$!
TRUE,I could not get my kid into a public school of my choice. Here in San Francisco public school system is detrimental to kids health.  Instead of neighborhood schools where kid can walk to school the system is forcing kids to be bussed across town to a 'Trading Places' schools in order to make all schools equally bad and dangerous.  I had to move out from the city because there were no places available in private schools either.  Now my kid is in a much better school district with much better public schools.  If I had a chance to place him in a private school in the city I would probably be still there.  Schools need to be better in order to attract parents and kids and not the other way around. Kids are not sacrificial part of our lives. We can not send them to bad schools hoping that the schools will get better if they do. The system needs to be set up in such a way as to cater to different level of kids the one where kids that aspire to go to college can coexists with the kids that want to just graduate and get on with their lives as well as the once ho aspire to spend their lives on government sponsored housing food and security guards. Currently the major city school districts programs adjust to the lowest performing kids leaving the rest to fend for themselves.   I do believe in a public education system. I am a product of one long gone system that was very demanding and unforgiving and proud of it.  I spend a lot of money on tutoring my kid who is a straight A student as-is just to get him to the level of private education and open doors for him in the future.  I believe that if public education system were to get better more people would opt-in. Saying 'bring your kids in and it will get better' is a bunch of BS.  It takes generations to make it better so the author wants to sacrifice a generation of well off kids for that. It will not happen not in a lifetime of a caring parent.   Bottom line kids are the most valuable part of life a parent can have and they are not Guiney Pigs. 	
TRUE,So if a company is terrible I guess I should keep buying from that company so they can make profits to make their product better.  And I can make that company better by buying their lousy product so they get money and also giving them my opinions to make their product better????   Better yet how about we banish all private schools and only have government schools.  Have you seen the quality of buildings and cars made by countries that do not have any competition with state run organizations. The quality is terrible  despite the benefit of getting all of the money and no competition.   Company's that are bad will get motivated to get better when they lose business.  Also my main concern right now is my children's education.  Any improvement in our schools if they were to happen  will be long after my kids grow up.  I am bad if I sacrifice my kids education for some philosophy.  When our country hardly had any private K - 12 schools did our public schools get better.  So why should it be any different now.
TRUE,While I can appreciate the arguement that we should all be working to improve the public school system I'm not willing to sacrafice my child to make it happen.  I don't believe that we can make changes fast enough for my children to benefit so I will continue to send them to the private school as long as I can afford to. 	
TRUE,My three children went to private grammar schools and two of them went to private high schools one to public high school. All three of them participated in sports programs were challenged academically etc. etc. My two daughters went on to excellent colleges; my son did not go to college...and all three of them have fantastic careers earning very decent livings. Would I change a thing?  Not on your life. 	
FALSE,This reasoning is so stupid! So the parents who send their kids to public schools are sitting on their asses allowing for poor education....but if the parents who send their kids to private school send them instead to public schools they will fix the public school system because they care more about their child's education than the rest of us? Correct me if I'm wrong but that's what I got out of all of this. Public or private we as parents all want what's best for our kids! 	
FALSE,Also homeschooling is an option too.	
TRUE,Public schools are a joke.  My tax dollars pay for children who can't afford to attend private school. Which gives your kids the opportunity to attend public school.  Which means I pay for mine and yours.  No monetary breaks for me and mine yet I don't complain that my tax dollars are going to inferior teachers kids that are being raised by retarded parents and lets not forget metal detectors and pedophile staff.  And don't let me start with the bullying epidemic.    Kristin Wong your an idiot for even bringing this up and Allison Benedikt your a loser.  Get a real job and pay for a real education for your children. Public schools can't be fixed. 	
FALSE,I'm not a parent but I believe parents have every right  to give their children anything that will help them in life. Besides I went to private for 8 years of my life. When I made the transition to public school I became aware of adult things and illegal substances. Also Parents have the money because they worked for it. No has no right to tell them how to spend it.
TRUE,"This is only a ""compelling"" argument to the MSNBC boobs who wrote this.  The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked ""first"". 	"
FALSE,"The writer states ""there are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school"" this should more properly have been stated ""there are a lot of bad reasons why people send their kids to private school"".  The reasons may be deemed bad but the people aren't.  They are only trying to do what is best for their kids and they can afford it.  They also at the same time contribute more to the public schools through higher property taxes than do their detractors.  The main problems with public education are bad parents and teachers' unions.  It understandable if people do all they can to avoid both. 	"
TRUE,"I'm dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university. What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence.. The father doesn't appear very well educated since he doesn't seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort. That's nice I suppose. And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn't speak for herself. I find them both rather frightening. Seriously. You actively with forethought work to deny your child an education? Even when they beg this from you? Wow. 	""Public school is what you and your parents make of it. If you don't do well it isn't necessarily the school's fault. It really is up to the student to do the work. Everyone I know went to public school and on to college. We didn't feel unprepared. Maybe schools were better then. I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them. """
TRUE,Public schools a place that teaches that here is no God! Christmas is not to be mentioned & don't you dare even think that any other than liberal ideas are allowed. Well thanks but no thanks children should be allowed to be free & not fed social idealism that fits obamacare! 	
TRUE,Tried hard to change the public system.  Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral.  It is a totally deteriorated system it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place. 	
TRUE,"my granddaughter just graduated from public school with a 4. grade average. she asked me what time it was once and I ""quarter after two"" she had no idea what that meant. she thinks 26% for a credit card is a good deal and had no idea what nuclear energy is  she has no idea of how the federal government works or even whos in it. ask her where electricity comes from and she points to the wall. shes not stupid shes just not educated if I had the money I would have sent her to a private school in a heartbeat"
TRUE,What a stupid argument!  You are a bad person if you don't do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible and if that means sending your child to private school that's what you do.   Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy some of had to sacrifice to do it but it was definitely worth every penny.   Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment. The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else.  IMO the only 'bad person' here is the person writing the article. 	
FALSE,Only msn would ask such a stupid leftist question.	
FALSE,"The religious exemption is the issue because it is this and this only that doesn't require accountability in VA. I have friends that home schooled in VA for non-relgious reasons and the kids had to take SOLs at their respective grade levels. 	""Why is it okay that students home schooled for religious reasons never have to prove they can read or add via the most basic SOLs at even the 3rd grade level? Why does VA see a different criteria for religious exemption home schooling and just general reasons to home school? ""	It will be interesting to see how this case progresses."
FALSE,Rude staff disgruntled teachers principal that doesn't return phone calls nurse is downright nuts whats not to like? 	
FALSE,"Anyone who as the audacity to criticize someone on where they choose  to spend their hard earned money ESPECIALLY when it comes to their child should really think about educating themselves on not passsing judgement. How dare you call someone a ""bad person"" based on making a personal choice. I have 2 nieces. One who attends Private School and the other who attends Public. It has nothing to do with my sister being a ""bad person"" that one has decided she prefers to wear a uniform and attend much smaller classes while the other has chosen a more expansive environment. She is equally dedicated to both schools and volunteering her time and energy when she can for the betterment of both of her children. Shame on this article. It is ridiculous."
TRUE,I've seen wrong and the writer takes it to the extreme. Whatever she's saying about getting involved in public schools proves she has no practical experience with the educational system.   First of all public schools DO NOT allow any outside influence or criticism of its curriculum. The unions protect the bad and inept teachers and administrators. Students are not taught discipline nor inspired to learn. When I see the stories of personal achievement is not to be recognized in fact it's to be discouraged due to other students self esteem I wonder why bother with an education. Competition is not condoned again self esteem issues with students and teachers. Tests are no longer pass or fail but how the teacher thinks a student should feel about the test. The idea that a student should graduate with the ability to be an independent thinker is repulsive to the school system.  Self initiative is not tolerated and all students will graduate with identical honors. Plus social activities tempered with diversity and tolerance are more important than basic math and English skills.   A private school has academic and social requirements that will be met by the student or they will not be allowed to return. Achievement and initiative are REWARDED at private schools. The teachers have a higher degree of success with smaller classrooms. Unacceptable behavior nor bullying is not tolerated and is the grounds for permanent expulsion. Is it any wonder which system turns out the better student and why higher institutions want the private school students? 	
TRUE,"When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families their neighbors and each other then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed ""different"" -- and not in the good way. Our entire society is based upon hate. Our government is based upon hate. Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies. Knowledge is power. Knowledge is the only thing that will save you. The best education is the only route to go; and it isn't in a public school system. 	"
FALSE,"Kudos for Josh Powell for his voyage and for his reaching out a helping hand and heart and brain to his brothers and sisters. I know one family that have very successfully home taught their children -and can vouch for the basic intelligence and content knowledge of their children-but I also recognize thta not all such efforts are succesfull 	Josh's case is different and he deserves lot of credit and recognition for his uphill voyage and especially for reaching out to help his brothers and sisters 	""I was more than somewhat dismayed at reading all the """"usual"""" infighting by commentatorswho went right for the left/right divide that we collectively choose to use on our comments- ""	"
FALSE,Anyone that would force a person to use a public school when they want to use a private school is a bad person. If you really want to improve public education stop treating it as an institution and start treating it as a business. Institute school vouchers where the money to educate each child goes with the child from school to school. If I pull my child from Edison Elementary they lose the funding for my child. The funding would then go to whatever public school I choose. Additionally If I choose to send my kid to private school I get a school voucher worth up to 50% of the amount to educate a child in a public school (ie. public school costs $10K per child per year property tax refund max = $5K) since my property taxes would then be wasted on a system I don't support. When a school discovers that poor performance can cost the school funding and possibly cost people their jobs you'll see a turn around and responsiveness to parents in short order.
TRUE,yes go to a public school so they are able to brain wash your kid into believing that homosexuality is normal and abortion is a good thing. 	
FALSE,Let the parent have the 20.000 in tax dollars to chose the school they want their kid to attend and we wouldn't even need home schools.
TRUE,I sent my children to Catholic school because I wanted them to get reenforcement about their Catholic upbringing plus I wanted them to have the freedom to celebrate the Catholic religious days including Christmas and Easter....Happy Holiday is not Christmas or Easter.  Christmas is the celebration of Jesis' birth and the public schools in Lakewood did not allow a nativity scene to be displayed or religious songs to be sung at the Christmas concert.  Easter is the celebration of Jesus' ressurection and the public schools in Lakewood did not allow a crucifix to be displayed.    I wanted my children to be in a loving and religious environment with religious FREEDOM!! 	
TRUE,"If you want your child to receive the best education they can get send them to a private/parochial school. If you want them to have more diverse co- and extracurriculars and go to a school where you don't have to pray for 10 minutes each day or have to attend mass on occasion send them to a LARGER public school. There is such a thing called ""Advanced Placement"" offered in both types of schools for the more gifted students."
FALSE,come on comrads we must all support the state schools	
TRUE,It sounds like this liberal writer equates good parenting with being a bad person. Perhaps she'd rather us all sign over our children to the state. Imagine how wonderful the world would be when all our children are poorly educated. 	
TRUE,Writers have a responsibility to be unbiased.  Public school has shortened hours and the school year in Orange County CA.   I send my son to a Catholic School and last year I saw what they were doing. Far better than when I was at that grade and far better than the local public school.    This writer is not thinking.   We all want our children to get a good education. 	
TRUE,There is no education in public schools any more! The government teachers unions and political correctness has killed them. If you want you children to get a good education private is the only way to do it! And no I don't feel guilty when I vote no on tax increases for their budget. Throwing good money after bad never works. Just look at how our government is run now. Most wasteful in history! 	
TRUE,"Sorry folks...the ""bad parent"" argument is completely insane !  Cute title though - certainly stirred up a response.  Why would you ""risk"" your child's ability to be resilient & 'probably' do ok in a crappy school - when you can improve your odds and start the race in a better place - with better tools ? That reminds me of when Unions pushed their people to ""only drive American made cars"" - even though they sucked !  Sorry dudes...make better products - and ""they"" will come !  American car companies got a SHOCK that forced them to step up their game - or become irrelevant and they got better because of it.  So too should the public school systems find ways to create better students...or close the doors.  Now don't get me wrong...there are ""A LOT"" of VERY legitimate reasons ""why"" most public school systems suck and I think there's definitely a HUGE crisis - particularly in the lower socio-economic areas.  I'd just rather focus a bit more deeply on the root causes of the crisis (lack of resources cookie-cutter teaching approaches crowded rooms ill-equipped teachers disengage parents doctored / 'standardized' testing...etc) - rather than the consequences of the problem.  If I had to pick one potential 'private school bad parent' opportunity to watch out for though it'd be more around the awareness of privilege. When private school kids were raised to think ""I pulled myself up by my bootstraps - and so should everyone else"" (...Mr./Mrs poor person) - they're being blind to the opportunities they had.  I think the ""private"" education community (generally speaking...) with all of that 'great' education could benefit from a bit more education around cultural competency.  It saddens me  that many 'educated' folks have only skin-deep understanding of the very significant & often debilitating impact a poor education (and all of its associated context) has. That can lead to an insensitive and often unrealistic 'solution' to the education problem.  Individual efforts get the focus & praise....and 'group privilege' becomes invisible - so the 'symptoms' argument continues.  Bummer... 	"
FALSE,This young man and likely his siblings are victims of an intent gone wrong.	
TRUE,"Maybe if Ms. Benedikt  look at the way Public Schools teach she would understand why we send are kids to Private Schools. Our Public Schools are broken and have been for some time. To much government administration and other factors have made our Public Schools nothing more than baby setter. It looks to me that Ms. Benedikt and others in the public school system are  part of the problem. Not the solution. Its time to get back to the three ""R"". And get government out of the are school system. Maybe then we wouldn't have to put our kids in a private school. 	"
TRUE,Modern public education system = moron factories.   Managed & taught by unaccountable fools (thanks teacher unions). Funded by corrupt moron politicians. 	
FALSE,I believe I support public schools with my wasted tax dollars.	
FALSE,"...And another thing...   Let's look at the 'flavor of the day' argument raising the minimum wage at McDonalds. I never eat at Mc. D's so I will use B.K.--(and I only eat there a few times a year-I'm in my 50's). But anyway if a Whopper costs $3.00...and I don't remember if that's high or not...but the point is if B.K. has to raise what they're paying the 'kids' working the broiler  from $7.50 to $15.00 bucks...the price of the Whopper will now have to be doubled to $6.00 (as well as many other menu items) to cover paying the workers twice as much. Point is  simple economics dictates certain things in a free market. With school systems it's taxes. I pay an exorbidant amount of school tax where I live and DON'T have any kids. Yet I'm paying for everybody elses children to get their ""free"" education. Those who have kids and can afford it will pay AGAIN to send their students to a private school to get the kind of education they believe they deserve but probably WON'T get at a 'government school' . In fact people with money to spare having to spend TWICE as much for education (their kids at a private school...and everyone elses at the public school) is just as big a waste of money as paying the local 19 year old fry-cook $20. bucks an hour. I would rather have him get his usual $8. dollars/hr. and only have to pay $2. bucks for  the frys. Then I can use the other $2. bucks to buy something else...or apply it to my overly high school taxes...or apply it to the private school bill that will be coming soon. Or better yet...how about I get a voucher for $3000. instead of a tax bill and use that money to off-set the private school bill? I'll bet then I could even find an extra $2. bucks in my wallet to get an order of frys on the way home from my long work day !   You see it's ALL RELATED !!"
TRUE,I don't know about the rest of Virginia but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools. The public schools are not churches and that seems to be the problem for some. There are many parents who attend my church who send their children to public schools to attain essential knowledge that they will need to find a job or go on to college. They also ensure that their children are trained in the Christian faith. It truly is not fair to deny children an education that they need to make their way in the world. Protecting them from heathen children is not a viable strategy. Once they start working or going to college they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old.
TRUE,"No you are not a ""bad"" person if you send your kids to private school.  Most public schools cannot handle really ""bright"" kids.  This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time.  Why?  They have to teach to the test so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given.  Kids that are really bright quick learners etc. get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up.  I know because I was one of those kids.  Many of these kids then go on to underachieve in middle and high school because their initial experiences left them bored and as a result often totally disinterested in school. Fortunately my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time.  That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent. Yes parents can provide support and should but when your child is bored at school there is only so much you can do to help with that. Occasionally you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class but if not then what? All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash or takes all night because they are so bored they can't stand it.  I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time."
TRUE,Benedikt seems to make an argument which compels me to understand she is both an idiot and a socialist. The author of this fawning endorsement suggests even more about Ms Wong - who is the bigger fool the fool that leads or the fool that follows. A big reason that parents don't put their kids in public schools is that public schools are forced to strive towards mediocrity in an effort to be inclusive.  This comes because public schools are run by the Department of Education which is part of a government which demands equality of outcomes not opportunity. Private schools were formed largely BECAUSE parents who wanted more for their kids could not effect changes in the system. Add to that the behavior problems which must be tolerated the acquiescence of school/parental authority to empower politically protected social groups the fact that public schools often practice indoctrination into political/social views to which many parents are opposed and an unwillingness to recognize and honor the value of hard work and achievement...it is no wonder parents with resources opt out of public schools...despite the fact they are forced to continue to pay for them through their taxes. The answer is not for people putting their kids into private schools to be demonized or perhaps even forced back into public schools but to provide a voucher system which will enable every parent to opt out if they want. 	
TRUE,Hmmm.... Lets see here.  Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ WRITE SPELL do MATH SCIENCEHISTORY but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too.  The hell with do they know how to read write etc. The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom Christianity is evil but don't hurt the sweet people of Isam's feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace. So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country. I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling. YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS.... GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS.
TRUE,The advantage of private school is simple my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children a top notch education.  The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch.  It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone but the parents can't afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich. Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools.  I know exactly what is spent per student the check I just wrote. 	
TRUE,The problem with this argument is that she's making an unstated assumption.  She is suggesting that public schools are even a good thing.  I don't have time to articulate all the reasons I believe this is a false assumption but suffice it to say that it's the parents' responsibility to educate their children not the government's. 	
FALSE,I believe that it's all about location. I am from a small town and the public school system here is wonderful. Both of my children will graduate with 15 - 21 hours of college credit. Then there is the school system that is only 20 minutes away from my town where my husband and I lived before we had children it is not the best. They do not offer the same type of classes nor do they push the children to be better. If I stilled lived in that school system my children would be in private schools. But we can not always just blame the schools for the way our children learn. We must look at ourselves such as are we involved in our children's education these teachers only have them for a short period of time we as parents must extend their education beyond what is being taught in the schools public or private. Remember our children's education started the day we conceived them. It is our responsibility as parents to continue that through out their lives we cannot always rely on others.
TRUE,This person failed to mention the most important reason to send your kids to a private college is for your children to gain an advantage over other children. If everyone was givien the same education there would be more competition. Parents have every right to send their kids wherever they want. 	
FALSE,"From a single parent who does not send her child to a private school.  Note	"" There are reasons why I would if I could and there are reasons why I wouldn't.  But that's not why I'm posting this 'comment'... 1. To label all parents as 'bad' for sending their kids to a private school is simply put prejudice.  2.  Not all parents that send their children to a private school have the same agenda (hidden or open).  I see/know of some who genuinely feel that a private school will give their child a better chance at a better career.  There are others that I see/know of that appear to feel it puts them in a classier category.  3.  I know many people who have gone to public schools and became very successful in there career and I know many people who have gone to private schools that haven't been so succesful. 4.  What would happen if EVERYONE wanted to and could send their kids to a private school??  Private schools would be like public schools?  Would we remove the entire 'public school' system build more smaller schools w/ smaller classes?  What? 5.  How a child turns out in attitude career common sense intelligence etc....  Depends only some on the school...  A bigger part of it is reliant on the PARENTS and what they teach them at home! Also on the childs natural ability and desire to learn.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.  Doesn't matter if you are educated publicly or privately in the end the child makes his/her own choice starting with what they've learned at home.     If a child is pushed too hard many times when they are set free they fail simply because they chose to finally enjoy the relief from the pressures they had at home.  They choose to begin living their childhood that they never had.  If a child isn't pushed hard enough they don't learn the value of working hard at something.  Really...  There's no perfect parenting no perfect education system.  HAPPY MIDDLE seems to be a good working system for many things. Educate Love Discipline and teach your children to RESPECT.  Everything else will eventually fall into place from there.    Parents as a whole need to stop judging and analyzing eachother and eachother's children.  Stop judging based on what school they or their kid went to.  Stop judging based on the success of their schools athletic successes.  Stop teaching their children to compete and instead teach them to work together.  Start teaching them equality.  Start teaching them by leading good examples themselves. """
TRUE,I make many sacrifices to send my kids to a Catholic school because I want God to be involved in their learning.  Besides that if all the private schools closed and all children were required to go to public schools wouldn't they get overrun with more kids than they could handle while bringing in the same amount of money?  I believe I pay the same taxes for the public school system even though I do not use it. 	
FALSE,If everyone followed her advise the public school system would be overrun and would collapse because all those new students wouldn't come with any additional funding unless of course the government raised taxes.  Then we would be bad people for causing everyone's taxes to go up.  Can't win I guess. 	
FALSE,Obama sends his kids to private school!	
TRUE,"There are some kids who thrive in public schools and some kids thrive in private schools. Some kids would not be able to handle the work load of a private school. One of the biggest differences is that public schools teach to a test and want the children to make the school system look good. Private schools challenge the kids to make the child look good thus making them look good. The public school systems are so big that some very bright kids fall through the cracks because they do not ""fit the mold"". I know I have one of each. 	"
TRUE,When the school is crappy because administration cares more about the money going into their pockets and less about the kids actually getting an education there isn't much parents can do.  They re-route tax dollars to themselves.  Happens all the time. In addition I don't like the liberal slant to everthing that is taught in public school.  I like knowing I have a say is what my children are learning. No parent would be able to change that in public school unless they are trying to get the school to be more liberal. 	
TRUE,"The ability for a parent to change a system is minimal. I could have afforded to send my child to private school--I sent her to public school knowing that I probably could overcome the system could save my money and could more easily afford to send her to college. Would I do it again? NO.   One is classified by the public school as one of the following	"" mentally ill a """"helicopter"""" parent a troublemaker. Schools don't want to work with parents. If one gets together with a group of parents to make things better--that group will probably dissolve quickly due to the school administration siding with the more minor members of the group giving their children the first and best of the goodies to get them to disrupt and help to dissolve the parental membership.   I disagree with this article--the best thing individually is to vote with one's feet by pulling the kids out of the schools and either putting them into private schools or home-schooling. There is too much administration in most systems--and those people make so danged much money (more than the POTUS or a Congress member) that they aren't about to play fair or work with parents. No--one has to just leave. It's the only real way to affect change--as they lose money for every student that they lose.   Just homeschool if you can't afford private schools--changing public schools is a Quixotian effort. """
TRUE,My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb. We pay very high taxes most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions  not how they derive at them.  As such there is pressure on the schools  to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place. Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems. I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving. We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life. So I say Allison Benedikt treat the cause not the system. I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life. I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do. 	
FALSE,This woman is an idiot.	
FALSE,WHO IS THIS PERSON and does she have any kids???!!!! I'm curious to know if she sent them to public school?? 	
TRUE,Parents deserve the right to choose the education for their children without being judged for it.  I grew up in private schools for a variety of reasons and it has helped me to succeed in ways that I may not have been able to if I had attended the public schools in my area.  My parents were involved parents who dutifully paid their taxes supporting the public school system while also paying my tuition.  They are far from bad parents and anyone suggesting otherwise is at best close minded and judgmental. 	
TRUE,What a joke !!! First of all those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes. Is we choose to send our children to a different  more expensive school in order to provide them with a better education So be it.  The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it's not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child's education in order to keep that failing system going.  My personal experience with the public schools in many districts is that they teach to the lowest common denominator. The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class. In the private school system the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student even if that mean expelling them from the school.  Most people who send their children to private schools would prefer to save the money and go public... if only that system could provide a first class education. The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy 	
TRUE,My child's education will not go into a holding pattern while public schools wait and try to legislate change. When I can afford better education and still pay property tax for public school why wouldn't I do that? My kid is in private school and I'm very pleased with the standards and exceptional educational value there. 	
FALSE,"So why don't the parents of the kids currently at crappy schools fix the problem?  Why do they have to wait for me or parents like me to come along and fix the problems they have been ignoring?    The writer should be encouraging more home owners to send their kids to private schools.  The money towards education will still be received via property taxes it just will not be utilized by the tax payers' kids. It is basically free money to the district at the expense of ""bad parents"". 	"
TRUE,"I am a product of Catholic schools. But when I went they were free. So it was not a place for people who could afford them but rather a place where you would learn your religion along with math history English science etc. But I lived in an integrated neighborhood in all sorts of ways (color religion nationality etc.) and so many of my neighbors attended public schools. Many people from both backgrounds have succeeded. I think it had far more to do with what each of us put into school. Yes I think I had great teachers. But my friends claimed that they did too and I believe them.   Over the years what I noticed was the big difference is that the public schools have become far too dependent on school boards. If left to the teachers I think things would go well. But in states like PA and NJ school districts are very small and it is fairly easy to get elected on some hot button issue rather than an overall view of education. Be honest many people run for school boards which pay nothing. What is in it for them. Sadly in far too many cases they do get some say on who gets contracts with the school. If you do not believe there are kickbacks then I suspect that my arguments will not convince you. But to get elected they have to please the parents who are notoriously not objective with regard to their own children. When I was in school if our parents complained they would have been told ""fine send him somewhere else we have a waiting list."" My parents trusted the sisters and brothers who taught us to know more about educating their son than they did (just as they trusted our doctor to know more about what was good for my health). Unfortunately now that Catholic schools are charging tuition in many cases they are falling into the same trap that the public schools faced some time ago.   Our graduate schools are the envy of the world. Why do so many people send their children here? But this is not so for our lower levels. Why is that? Could it be that our university teachers are much more free with what they can teach? They do not face the interference brought on by having to please so many board members helicopter parents etc. They are free to just teach. The charter schools are making a move this way. But they are also not as free.   From what I can see most teachers are very good and want to help children. How about we give them a chance. When I hear the rhetoric by people like Christie who want to fire teachers as if that would solve the problem I get very upset. If they have the power to fire teachers they will not fire because of incompetence they will fire older teachers and hire inexperienced ones merely to save money. If people faced these problems more honestly they would be a lot easier to solve. 	"
FALSE,Unbelievable......This lady is an absolute idiot.  You cannot expect a broken system to change just like we cannot expect the government to live within a budget.  This was shown in the last election when the makers were outnumbered by the takers.  We live in an entitlement society at present perpetuated by our current administration.  The change we are making by pulling our kids out of public schools is exactly the message that needs to get sent.  To whomever wrote this stupid article.....Better to be silent and thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.  You have just succeeded in the latter....... congratulations. 	
TRUE,"There is no reason whatsoever to support public schools; the are dysfunctional training grounds for life on the Government Plantation. Property owners should demand property taxes paid in the past back for the historic and ongoing failure of public schools. Local and state officials should be ashamed to show their faces in public. ""Everything run by the fed.gov is failure ..."" -Doktor Thomas 2002.  The journalism on MSN is some of the poorest in the Nation. That speaks clearly about the quality of the school system they love."
TRUE,"Wow!  I don't often weigh in on articles but seriously???  This is such a narrow-minded thought process.  I have two children one went to public school (finished) the other is attending Catholic school (9th grade).    They are 5 years apart and their personalities couldn't be more different .  We did send my older son to Catholic School as well and it was disaster (he was miserable there it had nothing to do with education but personality).  My younger son thrives there.   The reason behind sending my children to Catholic school was for Religious reasons and having it stated that is a ""less compelling"" reason is an argument I won't get into right now.  I say the final decision for most of us is based on what is best for our children whether it be educational resources the need for smaller class room size or simply the ""family like"" atmosphere in most private schools that allows our children to thrive.   In actuality the parents who send their children to private school should be thanked as if every private school student went to public schools there is no way that local governments could handle the influx.  You think the school system needs revamping now? Let that happen and then see what mess we wind up with!    And just as a side-bar most of us who send our children to private school are not rich we make sacrifices to do so."
FALSE,If a kindly person had imprisoned the Powell children against their will and refused to provide them education or the freedom to participate in society as they wished it would have been a dramatic case of kidnapping that the Post would have reported extensively. Editorials would have been written. Legislators would be outraged. What is the difference here? Why is it allowable for parents to emulate the Taliban and keep their children in ignorant servitude but not strangers? 	
TRUE,Total and complete BS. My son was tossed around public school written off as a bad kid because he has high function autism and bipolar disorder. Only when he started a private school did he learn and grow mentally emotionally and socially. Public school does need a full and complete do over but don't tisk parents that make a conscious decision to send there kid to private school. Most parents that try to make a diff are not heard. I was one of them. I had to involve the state and district physiatrist just to get results on proper schooling. I got lucky I had one person in my son's school admin on my side most single parents don't get squat for help from the schools. Usually the school admin try to blame the parent for not being involved enough when all the parent is trying to do is make sure their kids get proper education! 	
TRUE,I completely agree with the author in fact I have been saying the same thing for years.   I also feel that tax breaks for private school tuition should not be allowed.  We all need to support our public schools as it benefits everyone.  The argument that public schools are poorly run and lacking in spite of increasing taxes is a copout.  A child's education is a joint effort especially these days.  We can't rely only on the teachers and administrators to supply that.  It does also require parental participation at home at school and on the school boards.  And like it or not the people most willing and able to do that often decide to send their children to private school because it is easier. That said I also have strong feelings about tenure and teacher burnout.  But the more we take away from public schools the worse things will get. 	
FALSE,"This writer is absolutely tyrannical and ignorant. So basically what she is saying is that she has decided that public education is the way to go for EVERYONE! Hello!!!! How about moving yourself out of the FIDEL CASTRO philosophy and into our wonderful 21 century democratic AMERICA! There are a million gazillion different children with all types of learning styles and exceptionalities. What works for 10 might not work for 50 obviously! Furthermore if the parents have the financial mean (i.e. they worked their tails off to provide a certain standard of living for themselves and their children) then they are more then entitled to do as they wish with their hard earned money. Who the heck does she think she is????? I don't particularly care for regular private schools as many have an elitist air about them but I am a Christian and would love to one day be able to provide a Christian education for my son. It is my right to choose whichever education I deem to be best for my child. This writer is insane quite frankly to be labeling parents of private school children as ""bad."" Seems to me the only bad amoral and unGodly person is herself."
TRUE,When public schools bring God Prayer and the Bible back into the schools then families will support the school system. The public school are in the mess they are in because they took God Prayer and the Bible out of the schools. 	
FALSE,"Oh and most private schools have had a successful ""No Child Left Behind"" policy for many many years. It's called required parental involvement 	"
FALSE,Alas I am too old to have children in school but my daughter is a school teacher.  I think it is alright to send your children to a private school but it is not the solution to the education problem we face.  The deterioration of the home is the root of the problem.  Good parents rich or poor are the North Star for the child and his education.  By good parents I mean those who have a strong moral code  read good books themselves and leave them out so that their children see what they read.  A discussion of the day at the dinner table after grace has been said and affection shown between mom and dad and parent to child. Love requires rules.  Love your children and require obedience.  Does wonders. 	
TRUE,In the area which I live the private school are a lot of money you can get just as good an education (if not better) in the public schools.  So why go!!!  Keeping up with the Joneses for a lot of folks there are also religions reasons as well as legacy.  Other then that there is not reason to sent your childern to a private school! 	
TRUE,I spend a good portion of my income on private (i.e. Christian) school it is my religious belief and MY RIGHT. My kids have never been to Disneyland/world or Hawaii nor do they have smart phones and such. As other people already commented we are indeed supporting the public schools by paying taxes and extending the life of the facilities and equipment by NOT using it.  The HUGE difference already pointed out is that in private schools it is a majority group of parents who totally invest in their children in every aspect. There are lots of great parents who send their awesome kids to public schools but many public schools unilaterally have to deal with the kids who basic needs of hygiene food sleep clean clothes and even some TLC are not being met despite the governments  many safety nets. And it shouldn't be the teachers job to fill in those gaps.  Therein les he discrepancy.  Does it really matter to the author of the article that my (and other private schools) turns out a few Bible thumping do-gooders in the world? 	
TRUE,Do you seriously think the answer is that simple?  I had my child in public schools for K-3rd grade.  He has learning difficulties and I spent a good part of my work day emailing calling and begging the school to do what had been agreed and contracting to for him.  It was about as successful as beating my head up against the wall.  We moved him - at great financial expense - to a private school that specializes in his learning difficulties ... not because we wanted to but because we had exhausted everything else short of suing the school system. Allison Benedikt needs to pull her head out of the clouds and come back down to earth where the real people live and struggle with the failing school systems.  Do I want to keep my child in private school costing a small fortune?  NO but I want to give him every advantage possible to succeed.   Now on the other hand I believe I should get a voucher for the private school for the money the school system logs on their website that they pay for each child - since I still have to pay taxes!
FALSE,I feel that a fundamental difficulty in any expansive right by parents to determine a child's education or upbringing is that it can easily become a right AGAINST the child. This article throws that conflict into sharp relief. 	
TRUE,Actually there is very little a parent can personally do to change or improve a school. Can we hire or fire teachers? Can we set the curriculum? Private schools are businesses and the parents and their children are their customers. Like any business that has competition you are going to try to offer the best to attract more customers. My son has Aspergers Syndrom and if I could afford a private school for him that would cater to his needs; you bet I'd ditch the public school system. In a heartbeat. 	
TRUE,"I have been a fan of the public school system for a long time but I finally left the public school system this year (after a 9 year commitment) becauseI realized no matter how involved I became how much money I raised how many PTA boards I ran how many enrichment programs I sponsored how many school board meetings I attended I could not fix the system.  The problem goes beyond the quality of the children attending or parental involvement.  In California there are 47-50 kids in a middle school classroom (38 in elementary school) an unyeilding beaurocracy too much focus on state test results a lack of critical thinking skills and huge budget cuts resulting in the elimination of arts sports enrichment programs etc.   Your writer fails to identify ""how"" exactly the return of the private school parent and child to the public school system is going to solve these problems. Enlighten me!"
TRUE,The constructive focus to the problem is to get the Public School Boards along with the PTA's and  the school communities actively participating in a crusade to improve each school.   Market forces at play people would pay more for what they want/need.   Our kids education is the single most important investment in our lives.   Of course we all would rather avoid the extra expense.   But if we feel that our kids need better education than the one given in Public Schools we will pay for a private school. Elevate the performance of Public Education and you'll see less people inclined to pay for private schools...    You want more support for Public Schools ???   Like anything else...   First you create the product and if the customers want it the demand for it rises...   Simple as that 	
FALSE,SO FAR I HAVE NOT NOTICED PEOPLE THAT SEND THERE KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL REALLY GETTING A CHOICE IN WHAT IS TAUGHT THERE. MANY COMPAINE ABOUT IT AND TRY BUT ARE KURBED BY LAW MAKERS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE SMALL BUT HAVE THE MONEY SO ARGUMENT IS NULL AND VOID 	
TRUE,"The argument that sending your kids to private school is bad parenting is nonsensical. I bothers me that Allison Benedikt (I suppose and intelligent woman) makes the statement and it further bothers me that this article says her argument is""compelling."" She argues that if parents who opt to send their kids to private schools sent their children to public the schools the schools would change. That's a foolish idea. How many parents are there have their kids in public schools that wish the school system was different. The answer is probably most. The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem.Problems in the schools systems are not the parents fault it's the systems fault. What are parents to do when Unions refuse to correct or fire ineffective school teachers because they have tenure and are protected by unions. What are parents to do when school boards respond for the calls for reform with the formation of yet another useless committee that will investigate the matter and make recommendations that are never put into effect. If millions of frustrated parents cannot change the system what makes you think a few others can. Your argument is stupid. and for the author of this article to call it compelling is sad. 	"
TRUE,"I feel my education was a perfect balance.  Private through 8th grade then public HS.  This idea looks logical on a Macro level sure... but it would take at least a couple generations before it paid off. Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the ""Reform Period"" by going private.  Private schools = better education? Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families.  If you don't want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality private schools are the only way to go. It's not that I was taught that it was wrong it was never a topic that was brought up. We were taught tolerance and acceptance. Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged.  That is what is wrong. They have a Gay Straight Alliance club but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as ""intolerant"" which is complete BS.  The people who are demanding ""Tolerance"" are the biggest hypocrites of them all. All of this is avoided at most private schools."
TRUE,"Public Schools....a free breakfast a free lunch and free babysitting for parents at home and for students in class.   In short if parents have an investment in the public school system they’re probably going to make its improvement a priority. So pay tuition like everybody who goes to private school so that you are truly ""investing in the education of your child"".   “I believe in public education but my district school really isn’t good! you might say. I understand. You want the best for your child but your child doesn't need it."" My child doesn't need it!!! By God and by Gumby if I can provide the best for my child I'll sure as hell will do so. Better education=Better job=Better Life. The very core of the American dream has been to make it better for our children. That they wouldn't have to struggle as hard as the previous generation. Who are you to tell me my child doesn't need better?!   Benedikt writes that if one can afford private school chances are their child will come from an environment that allows them to overcome “a perfectly crappy public school.” “She will have support at home (that’s you!) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education—the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy.” Why should my child have to overcome ""a perfectly crappy public school'. It appears from this statement children at crappy public schools do not have parental support or parents who care about a better education for their child. How is my child going to a crappy school supposed to fix that?! Perhaps the child going to a crappy public school has parents who went to the same crappy public and they just say that's the way it is. They didn't get involved as a student they aren't involved as a parent.   Parents of private school students tend to be property owners and pay both a property tax to support public schools and a tuition to support their child in private school. It is both physically and fiscally impossible for the public school system to absorb the private school system. Public schools are if you ask ANY public school employee overcrowded and underfunded. Where will you put all these students? Where will the teachers come from? How will the public school system pay for it all? It's not like they are going to get an influx of money from taxes you already get!! Maybe a little State or Federal monies; but certainly not enough.   Private schools tend to be more disciplined and less tolerant of troublemakers with a better learning environment. After all they can expel students from the ""good"" school and send them to ""a crappy public school"" where perhaps the parents will take an interest. Public schools seem to tolerate any kind of behavior or classroom environment have a horrific learning environment. They just pass everyone along until they drop out or graduate as an illiterate let down by the ""public school system"".   Education is a 2 way street. Competent teachers must teach and the student must apply their self to learning. A classroom needs to be a controlled learning environment not a battlefield of mayhem and destruction. Those that want a good education should have one. Those that don't and could care less about it can become cannon fodder and even that's becoming more difficult in the modern military.   The saying is	"" You get what you pay for....a free public school education well there you go. Perhaps if students attending public school had to pay tuition as well then perhaps the parents would be more """"invested"""" in their education. But if you care less about your child's free education you probably won't care about the one you pay for either. A parent who cares about the quality of their child's free education will take an interest in it and if they can provide a better education chances are they will. """
TRUE,"Once again ""free"" shows its worth.  Parents that can afford to give their children better do which means you get a condensed group of non caring parents.  The only reason the government cares about public education at all is the control and the potential revenue.  What more proof “free” public education has failed the highest test scores across the nation come from Home school kids.   They are courted by the top colleges and prove their worth time and time again.  Why?  Concerned active parental involvement.  Those that constantly expect someone else to clean up their mess raise children that act the same no personal responsibility. Teach them yourself or take a lone and send them to private school but get your kids out of “Free” public education if you want them to ever succeed. 	"
FALSE,Crappy schools tend to have a lot of crappy students from crappy families.  Affluent families who can support crappy schools cannot fix crappy families and their crappy children.  Benedikt's got it backwards.  It's crappy people who crap up their own surroundings.  Witness the crappy schools with the accelerated classes filled with non-crappy students.  Then observe their other students. 	
TRUE,The only way to fix the public school system is to have it totally collapse.  One way to help achieve this is to send more children to private schools. 	
TRUE,This woman is typical of the liberal mindset.  Sure send your kid to an inner city school where teachers are lower salaried and less motivated. Where I live kids have to pass through metal detectors so that they can be taught things (political views) that I personally don't believe in. People who send their kids to a private school still support the local school system through their school taxes.  This is still America and people have choice and the right to make that choice. Wong is wrong... 	
FALSE,First off we DO support the public school system. We still pay the full amount of taxes to the school and I would bet I pay more than about 50% of kids that go there. The school charges me more just because my house is 300 square foot bigger than my neighbors. So what do I receive that's worth 300 more? You are looking at a result after 100 years and then asking the question in reverse. I would say what can the public school system do to lure the kids away from private schools?  First thing would be to drop the Common Core circ. Second stop using our tax money to feed breakfast to kids and start buying teaching supplies use money for teaching not feeding we already pay tax money for food stamps and then pay again to feed them at school. Then when the other kids in school who's parents don't even think it is necessary to work for a living fail tests they lower the standards so the school will still get the same amount of money from the state for having good grades. So that means the harder working students learning will not be up to what they are able to learn.     Third bring back a religious section of school and let kids that want to learn in a religious environment  be able to do so but don't mix them with students that think religion is a waste of time.    Bottom line this writer want to take the good performing schools and make them like the poor performing schools when it should be the other way around.       And by the way was this letter written to Obamma because he won't send his kids to a public school
TRUE,She forgets that the public schools are first and foremost a political institution. As we have all seen those systems are the hardest to change the slowest to change and what change there is is driven by a majority. These days the majority are morons. Thanks but I will keep my kids in private schools where they learn more and in a safer enviroment. 	
TRUE,This unfortunately is why people go to private schools.  The public schools are in trouble because they define away problems.  Criminal conduct is called something else so the school does not get a bad reputation.  In an effort to appeal to everyone the public schools give up standards.  And finally isn't the customer right.  If I do not get the service I want I take my business somewhere else.   This woman's thinking is backward.  It is the public bureaucracy that needs to change.  We need less fringe classes and a focus on traditional core subjects i.e. math science English and composition.  People move away from public schools for good reason.  Public schools in my experience are more violent. 	
FALSE,WONG IS WRONG . . .	
TRUE,"I love that this article gets blamed for the ""liberal agenda."" It is the same argument against the Affordable Care Act. Each of us thinks that we can only think of ourselves and some how our communities will prosper? Public education is about our ability as a nation to progress yes progress into the future. Without everyone being educated this whole nation falls apart. No education no jobs no economy. Those that can afford private school are blessed there is no denying that but they are also part of a community and a nation. Paying taxes is fine and good but if you believe the teachers are bad... the best way to fix that is to get into a teacher's face each day and push them to give your child the best. Paying for private school avoids the larger problem in our country and anyone that doesn't have a child should probably stay out of the discussion. Vouchers will drive the participation out of the public sector. That's what everyone is bitching about... in the end no on trusts government because it has no morals and in doctrines your children to be more progressive. Face it in one generation same-sex marriage will be legal we will continue to have minorities for elected officials and yes public school will continue because of people like me and the FAITH I have in the United States of America!! 	"
TRUE,I just pulled my child out of public school because of the incompetent teachers there. I have always been involved in my children's education in the public school. I am a teacher myself and I give 100% of me everyday to my students but unfortunately where my kids go to school they don't. I am thank-ful I could afford to send them to a private school. I give up other things to do that. I work hard and the American way allows me to make those choices.
FALSE,I wouldn't send my kids to a public school in the area either. But then all my kids are grown up. 	
FALSE,"Public schools in DC. Spelling ""Y U K ""	"
FALSE,"Two goals of the progressive (communist) party as outlined by Cleon Skousen in his 1954 book ""The Naked Communist"".   17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks. 41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents."
TRUE,"All I got to say is she is "" Very Wrong "" and how much does the writer know about private education? The class size in a private school is much smaller meaning the kids it a lot more of one on one with there teacher. 	"
FALSE,you only have one shot at educating your children--make it count!	
FALSE,Was educated in three states before completing college. Five in New England one in Missouri many in California.  The educational quality varied considerably depending upon district.  One school was Dominican parochial balance were all public schools some catering to military brats some to minority enrollees (dominant Asian Black mixed European refugee or Latino emigrant).  Some were rated superior others ghetto inadequate. Did I sense a quality difference?   You better believe it.  Some transfers I made accelerated me three grades beyond where I'd been; others made me hustle for inclusion. The private Catholic school only taught in French and no one in my family ever used French. Math and science classes varied as did athletic programs. It was mostly a matter of tax base accounting for quality variations but politics also skewed the job scene. (It paid to have rich powerful handsome bachelor uncles.) If the area catered to a lower rental-class student  less quality followed because staffs jockeyed for prestige areas if they possessed prestige credentials. Rough 'hoods are tough on anyone even Utopian of Angels.   Inner-city low-income 'hoods displayed most deficient quality except for San Francisco where the system offer was stellar. Military-oriented public schools challenged but on a personal level (I'd become accustomed to receiving gloved recognition) were cold dispassionate quota driven mills. In the Fifties-Seventies all adults paid taxes and weren't given options or deductions for private school enrollments. One could send offspring to a private school but responsibility for full tax payments was required as though you had a dependent benefitting from public education. Taxpayers supported public schools; back then anyone between aged 5.5 to 18 was obligated to be enrolled unless graduated from high school (age 14-19).   If you've time survey classes for a day.  Listen to instructors observe the students.  Do that at several schools keeping grade level/courses observed constant.  You'll be amazed at your judgment if you've varied the sample fairly.    Ask your kids if they think they're getting/not getting quality standards/values too. Ask them reasons they feel their exposures are inadequate/superior. Ask them if they're progressing fast or being slowed due to others preparational handicaps or attitudinal clouding. Kids know more than you would believe.
FALSE,totally RIDICULOUS you send your kids where you want to	
TRUE,Allison Benedikt  is so wrong. I had to take my kids out of the public school because it was so bad it was affecting them emotionally. As a good parent you try to do your best at giving them the best education it can possibly can. What I think has to improve is the education the parents give them at home. I remember a time when there were truant officers and parents made sure their kids went to school or they would be penalized. 	
TRUE,"Typical liberal media article on the ""rich"" vs public education.  Start the article by stating that the wealthy should INVEST IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS...really I assume they pay their property taxes (more dollars of them than most in fact) just like the other property owners.  If the writer means ""invest your time and talent; become involved"" in your public school system then my answer is that every time I have attended a school board meeting it is patently obvious that they want no questioning or suggestions from the parents.  I could go on for pages but I will end by saying that I hurt them (my public school system) in the worst way I could.....I home schooled all four of our kids. 	"
TRUE,The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price. Up until now we were able to afford it but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision. And believe me it has been an adjustment. Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care. Wow!!! If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation. Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices. In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas and she is actually graded and not passed along if she can just get by. I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher. I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government. I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else but I can see the public school system just isn't what it used to be and that's why I want to send her to private school. If we could afford it I would home school and be done with the system all together. 	
TRUE,"People should have and do have the right to send their children to the schools they prefer. If someone can afford to send their children to a private school and feel that it is better than or more to their viewpoint than the public schools in their area they do and should have the right to their own decision. If you don't want to send children to a private school and that is your point of view fine! Don't. Also many suburban and other school districts are highly successful and produce a high quality graduate.   Having worked in inner city schools for most of my educational career I would not want to send my children to those schools if I lived in those districts if I could avoid it. Many of the youngsters come from difficult home situations poverty and a lack of involvement from parents in the educational process. There are extreme behavior problems which are often tolerated by the parents and the school area. Schools under the current conditions are forced to allow difficult and behavior problem students to be mainstreamed. Any successful disciplinary actions are not allowed by the school administrators politicians and courts. So the difficult students disrupt education for all of the students and very little can be done to solve the situation. This includes violent outbursts and violent attacks on other students. Principals and teachers can do almost nothing to truly deal with the situation and so there will be no improvement in the public education until these problems are addressed. The needs of the ""difficult"" students are the  concern of the politicians and student rights' organizers. However they forget the needs of the rest of the students. Private schools have the luxury of removing difficult students and sending them back to the public schools. Also private school parents are agreeably very concerned and involved in the education of their youngsters and that is all to the favor of the youngsters attending them. 	"
FALSE,My teenagers have attended private schools their entire life. I am not rich in fact I receive a scholarship for both of my children otherwise I would not be able to afford the tuition. The remaining tuition is a sacrifice but well work it. One of my children has dyslexia. The public school system told me she would receive a certificate of completion. I'm proud to say she will soon be receiving her DIPLOMA from a private school. 	
FALSE,This sounds like some Hippy from the 60s.  So I'm a bad person because we moved to a suburb in 1980. That was the year forced busing was started in our town. Not for education but for integration. Anyone who could get out moved. Look at the inner city schools now. You sound like you might have been one of the plaintiffs in the discrimination case. How has that worked out for ya lady?  Bad education high drop out rate very high teen age and interracial pregnancies. And you  think I'm a bad person because I moved away from this. I think it's people like you that has caused this country to be the way it is.
FALSE,How about the president and all those big shot democrats and some republicans sending theirs to private school? Or is that a different case. 	
FALSE,As a public school administrator I have to say I find the argument less than persuasive.  (Like my neighbors I contribute to the funding base for our local schools regardless that any personal benefit from this is subjective and conditional. I'll never have a student in those schools. And yet my input and support remain difficult to quantify.)  This argument (from the article) just smacks of the same unbalanced reasoning.  What's the converse argument?  People without children in the public school system should have no or a lesser role? 	
TRUE,Well--I'm already paying for Public Schools via my taxes and the varying tax levies on top of sending my children to private school. I'm paying TWICE! I pay my taxes/ levies just like anyone else in my neighborhood who's children attend public school.  On top of that my kids take their private education seriously and once-a-week go to the inner city public schools and teach young students how to improve their reading.  Both the parents of private schooled children and our children themselves are doing our part to help the public schools. As other posters have stated. It's not the money it's the politics behind the schools themselves the lowered standards of education (our US math scores are abysmal) and the funding of GREAT teachers and discontinuing paying and boosting teachers that don't perform. 	
FALSE,Benedikt your reasoning is totally wrong. Rich people send their kids to private school cause local school is bad but rich lives there and pay tax they actually support it. Your argument just leaves the rich to move to a better place with better public school and let the local bad school getting worse becasue of shortage of revenue from tax. 	
FALSE,In the age of technology school can be anywhere and everywhere people choose. The quality of private or public education both depend on the assets knowledge resources ambition and the persistence that a student can have access to. The sky has no limits. In the digital divide over whether or not computers should be used for teaching and learning parents can provide a classroom that is free of distractions. Children can learn with or without technology. It is a choice. Independent choice is what makes American values so precious. 	
TRUE,I send my granddaughter to private school and I am far from rich. In fact my husband lost his job last April and has been unable to find a job. We struggle to pay for the education but we are not going to send her to public schools to be taught revisionist history and have a lack of morals and values. We are forced to pay for the failed public schools and then pay additionally to have her educated in the way WE want since we are her guardians. We will not settle. 	
TRUE,Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools.   The Liberal Democrats Black Racists Ignorant Civil Rights nuts Atheist and the ACLU have made our Public School System a disgrace to education.    Parents put their kids on a Public School Bus or drop them off at a Public School.  When they do they never know if they will ever see their child alive again or have their child's innocence stolen from them or have their child's future altered and scared forever.   One thing is for sure. Kids are indoctrinated not educated in Public Schools.  Academics? Not in Public Schools. 	
FALSE,This is America. Not a socialist nation. We have the right to choose whatever we can afford. That is one of the things which makes our nation great. Sorry but this article is as left slanted as you can be. 	
TRUE,Parents have the right to send their children to private schools. They pay for it in addition to paying for the public schools in their taxes. So they do invest in public schools even of their child does not attend them. Stay out of people's personal business! 	
FALSE,a religious exemption	Since when is it Constitutional to make compliance with the law conditional on what your religious beliefs are or are not? 	
TRUE,I was on the fence about public schools for the kiddos...after this article...I'm 100% sending them to private school.
TRUE,We certainly are NOT wealthy but we choose to send our children to a Catholic school where they can learn our faith as well as benefit from smaller class sizes and high academic expectations.  We enjoy being part of a very involved and caring school community.  We have shared one family car-a 7 year old Dodge mini-van and make many other financial sacrifices in order to make this possible for our children. I am happy to shop consignment stores and forego other luxuries such as vacations to give my kids the best possible education.
TRUE,she is obviously a liberal.  only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset. what she fails to recognize is the more money you have the more you give to charity. you donate your time you give away clothing/shoes/coats to the needy you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies food banks etc. people with money give more. simple as that.  you don't need to take additional tax dollars to prove that.  i live in an area (Georgia) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here.  it is not safe the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity.  sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn't mean they are bad parents it simply means they want more for their child.  if that means sending them to private school then so be it.  no difference in home schooling.  you can demand all you want but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too then it's all for not.  teachers claim they are not paid enough.  well excuse me but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher. you had to intern somewhere?  you had to research it before you decided that would be your major? you say you have to spend your own money for supplies.  why?  demand the school provide. if they can't provide you can't teach. if you can't teach then someone will take notice.  private schools will always be around. always have been whether it be Catholic school or Christian school.  it is what it is.  don't try to make parents feel guilty about it.  if you don't like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders. 	
FALSE,"The idiot writing this article should ashamed for pushing a left wing agenda. The ""bad"" wealthy people that send their kids to private school are already invested in public schools by virtue of paying taxes.If memory serves me right I'd say they pay a lot more taxes than other people too. There has been an assault on every business that is not unionized for the last 50 years. Private and Catholic schools are no exception. The author is giving a shameless boost to more spending on public sector unions and the massive amount of waste that comes with it. The real question is ""If there were no public schools in existence and every parent had a choice as to where their kid went then would it cause schools to try harder and be better so they would attract more customers? "" It works in industry and in retail. If you are terrible at what you do then you fail and go out of business. Public schools petition other government entities to fund them and then raise taxes on everybody regardless of the amount of fraud and waste in the district. We Are going through it right now in Philadelphia. 50 million dollar shortfall before the schools even open. Any other business would fold up by monday morning but what does Philly do? Fight about whether the newest taxes imposed on their residents should go to fund current or retired employees. There is no talk of cutting budgets fraud or waste."
TRUE,At what expense to our children? First it will take to long to make the changes needed if you could get them changed at all. The first 10 years or more would focus on trying to fix the system that is very broken and having to build more schools. So these first children coming from the private schools are leaving a better education for what? I for one wouldn't sacrifice my daughters education in HOPE to have a better education for children in the future. That is not my job that is the job of the state. When they figure it out then ok maybe we could see it different but in the mean time we are doing whats best for our children and that is admirable.
FALSE,Most schooling is a mess.  Liberal teachers brainwash our kids right through college!!!!	
FALSE,What a weak argument.   I pay my taxes and my township has a school board and administration that is paid with those taxes (all overpaid with fat pensions I might add)-fixing the school system so I would want to educate my children there is their job not mine.   It is bad enough that I have to pay the taxes and then send them somewhere else; being implicated as part of the problem is beyond insulting. 	
FALSE,The Catholic schools ( which anyone can attend for the same cost the public school cost the tax payers) were formed because their values and believes were being undermined by the people in charge of the public schools. The public schools force them out. Here is another socialist wanting to rewrite history forgot the past and indoctrinate the young their distorted believes.. And since most board of educations members are there to get their agenda through and could care less what anyone else wants. 	
TRUE,"Go on Netflix and watch ""Waiting for Superman"". Quite the eye opener. It's not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools. What does that tell ya about are public school system? In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher's union. (Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason.) They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary. The teacher's union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers. This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children's education and the union shot it down. If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it. Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won't allow it."
FALSE,"Another liberal that blame the rich for all the problem of the country!  The evil rich who create jobs invest so companies might expand and pay (a lot ) of taxes!     Why is it the Rich should always ""fix"" it! How about it starts at home and stop voting for these liberal policies!   Personal responsiability would do a lot to start the fix but these liberals want to blame someone else !    They get out tax money anyhow so if all the ""rich"" kids went back to public schools they would be short of teachers the schools to small so we would have to raise taxes some more to get new ones !    I do not blame folks that are voting against tax increases as the liberals with there tax increases are forcing the poor middle class and retired to be forced to  move out of there house for not being able to afford the taxes ! 	"
TRUE,"IT IS NOT DOLLARS!!!    It's the parents commitment.  In our town the public schools are great! But parents are involved and there is ZERO tolerance for bad behavior.  The school has a modified grading system...A 93% is a ""B"" a 87% is a ""C"" and a 81% is a ""D"".  The town has 7.5% unemployment  45% of the kids on assisted lunch program and Average per capita income of under $45K/year.   It can be done if the parents and school work together!   30% of last years seniors graduated with honors.   IT CAN BE DONE and it isn't DOLLARS!"
TRUE,Propaganda - not compelling logic.   Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars.   If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I'd be saving money (not the school) - but I'd be not doing the best I can for my kids.   My kids are better educated  and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple. Why should I subsidize others who don't make the same degree of personal sacrifice? 	
TRUE,Catholic schools teach students how society works on a secular and non-secular world. The school is not there  to protect the student rather to guide the way and offer choices on how they will become part of society. God's greatest gift to mankind is Free Will but we must all learn how to handle this responsibility. Catholic schools go beyond the rules and teach society lessons through cause and effect. 	
FALSE,These people should be in jail for abusing their children. Wild fanaticism is not an exccuse for this. 	
FALSE,This is the throu	
TRUE,IF this were true then why don't the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it?  You're blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust (often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure) yet ignoring the obvious.  If the problems could be solved by more involved parents (and a majority of them probably can be) then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved.  If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are 'stuck' there demanded better likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools.   Bottom line Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system (see also
TRUE,In a perfect world everyone would send their kids to a public school and make it the best system possible. The question to ask will one person/parent make a difference? What parent out there who really cares for their child wants to take that chance? I started out an idealist who thought by my community involvement I could make a better world for my kids The social acceptance of greed in the 1980's and the immediate gratification needs of our society today make us ask if we will still have a world tomorrow - much less a better world tomorrow. Now that I have grandchildren I am glad my kids send their kids to private schools.
TRUE,I couldn't come up with a more illogical argument.  Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school even if they voiced their concerns.  So why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately?  Seriously do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms? 	
FALSE,"Sounds like class warfare to me.  What happened to ""Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness""? This is another socialist point of view spewed by some fool who has absolutely no understanding of economics.  This is another socialist attack to steal from the rich to give to the poor just wrapped in the guise of education. 	"
TRUE,"This is bat insane?    Parents are supposed to sacrifice their kids on the altar of public education in the rather thin hope that if ""everyone does it"" that the schools overall will get better and THEN their kids will get a better education!!!   I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools.    And as a public school teacher I'm well aware of those problems.   No one should be expected to sacrifice their kids for the ""greater good"" if at all possible. 	"
FALSE,"Why are the people ""Bad People"" who send their kids to private school?  Quite judgemental on your part don't you think.  Who put you in charge of who's good and bad because of the choices they make for their children.   Just because YOU don't like it doesn't equal ""bad people"".  You seem to think VERY highly of youself to be able to judge a persons character by what type of school the send their kids to. The beautiful thing about America is that everyone should have the personal freedom to choose private school pubic school( which everyone is required to support weather they like it or not BTW through taxes)  or to homeschooling.  The only ""bad people"" in my opinion would be the people who believe..  that the overcrowded public school system should be the ONLY way.  our taxes already support the schools now the ""bad people"" believe the only way to make the schools better is to send children from private school to public?  Are they going to be teaching the classes?  how would that make it better? 	"
TRUE,"Am I a bad person to fly First Class because Economy stinks?? Come on!  If I had the money I'd send my kids to private school too. This is a free country with freedom of choice and that includes the choice where I send my kids to school! Even within the public school system parents try to place their kids in the best school districts and/or schools going as far as making sure they move to the ""right"" zip code! 	"
TRUE,Very poor logic.  Are we to conclude that only the parents of children who attend private school care about the schools?  Why can't the parents of children who do attend public schools change the system? I will tell you why because the Federal Government has completely muddled up what local communities can and can't do to improve their public schools.  They may provide money but they also dictate how that money and locally raised money is spent.  On top of everything else parents who send their children to private schools at least where I live do support the public school system through paying taxes. 	
TRUE,I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level. Many conversations with the Principal and teachers. He began to start not caring about school itself he was very bored. I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School. I made 7.50/hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school. It was the best investment I had made.
TRUE,My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that's a big reason we sent her to Christian private school.  Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance.  What’s next?  Really I'm bad because I want my daughter to know Christ. 	
FALSE,Public schools DO receive support from wealthy parents who send their children to private schools - TAX DOLLARS. If the administration teachers and parents who ARE in the schools cannot use those dollars and their desire to improve their own surroundings to make public eduction better then far be it from me to sacrifice my child thinking it will change anything either. 	
TRUE,I have 3 older siblings who went to public school because at that time that was what my parents could afford.  My parents sought out the better of the public schools in our area (Washington DC) at the time.  By the time I came along my father had his own business and was then financially able to send me to private school from Pre-K to college.  What I noticed is that my neighborhood friends that went to the local public school where far behind me academically.  The private school I went to taught me information almost two grades ahead of them.  There were smaller classes and the teacher didnt scream all day trying to keep some kind of order in the class.  I currently am a contract nurse for DC public schools and I see how these children are severely neglected and no one seems to care.  The parents can make a difference but in my opinion alot of times they only seem to rally together  when a student is killed or some extreme violence occurs at the school.  My vote is for private school.
TRUE,There's no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today's times.  The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways.  Just about every week cops are called to this school because of either a shooting/stabbing.  The neighboring county public schools are the same.  Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same.  I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school (one that I had done a lot of background checking into first).  Not saying that private schools don't have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have. 	
TRUE,I sent my kids to a private religious based  school. I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives. Also if your children attended this school parent involvement was an expectation. As a result every Home/School association meeting was packed. Everyone went to orientation. I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with. Disipline was never a problem - if there was a concern with your child you met with the teacher and/or the principle and worked out a solution. They never had any issues with bullying (they had an anti-bullying program before it was popular). My daughter chose to attend public high school. In a school of 2500 kids less than 10% of the parents attended orientation. The main problem with public schools is parent participation. What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids. There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result there is a tendancy for the parents to side (usually unfairly) with their kids. Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive constructive members of society then you will wind up with what we are seeing. A school system that is struggling against the odds to somehow marginally educate our children. There's nothing wrong with private schools. People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it.
FALSE,"Moronic Logic... ""Wealthy parents should forgo a private education for their children and instead invest in the public system."" This article misses doesn't address the MAJOR point in that ""rich"" people pay property and state income taxes and get no benefit from public school since they pay tuition for their kids to attend private school.  That means the $$$ for their kids GOES to the public school.  The real question is why our public system the most expensive in the world isn't performing? Or maybe it's the parents commitment.  In our town the public schools are great!  But parents are involved and there is ZERO tolerance for bad behavior.  The school has a modified grading system...A 93% is a ""B"" a 87% is a ""C"" and a 81% is a ""D"".  The town has 7.5% unemployment  45% of the kids on assisted lunch program and Average per capita income of under $45K/year.   It can be done if the parents and school work together!"
TRUE,I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society.  I have been advised to put my money in private schools or else save it for attorneys later.  It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better.  It wouldn't work anyhow. 	
FALSE,So we should all seek out the worst possible school to send our children to so this ****ing moron is happy? What about poor inner city schools that are infested with gang and gun culture? Drugs? One of the most idiotic statements I have ever heard. I'm guessing this moron either has no children or the schools in her district are A-Ok. 	
TRUE,There are good and bad in this argument. Just because a parent(s) can afford to send their kids to a private school doesn't mean they are more or less involved with their kids schooling. Some send the kids to private schools because they can't/won't be bothered with getting invovled. Others because the can and have more say in the schools teachers and curriculum than they do in the public schools. And most public school administrators don't want to fight teachers unions over a bad teacher nor take the time and put forth the effort to fire one so they continue to teach. No one should blame a parent for wanting the best education for their child and certainly you can argue that if all parents had their kids in public schools they would be better but that is not reality and there is no way one can logically argue that nor should people blindly believe it. There are politics in education and when the school system is overseen by a bunch of ineffectual congressional leaders that can't agree on anything how can Allison really believe it will make a difference? 	
FALSE,Why is religion a less compelling reason to send your child to a private school?  And what does the author make of parents living in an excellent public school district yet opt to send their kids to private school?  And is the author conceding that private schools are in fact better than public schools; at least to an extent that she wants to move the private school kids to the public schools in order to make public schools better.   If this was cold war Russia and not present-day United States of America her argument would make absolutely perfect sense. 	
FALSE,The only reason I can see for this myth to continue to be perpetuated is to undermine homeschooling. Why else given that it's been so thoroughly debunked over the years? 	
FALSE,I went to a private Catholic school all through elementary school and then I was sent to an all girl private Catholic High School.  I despised school so much that I refused to go to college. I have 4 children one of them went to private Catholic School and graduated high school.  She is a professor. Two of them went to private Catholic elementary school but went to public high school.  My oldest son is Lt. William Silverberg in the air force and is a pilot My younger son is currently applying to Medical School to become a Surgeon. My last child went to public school only all the way until she graduated high school. She is currently in college and is studying Psychology. Those are the facts...nothing says I am a perfect parent I am a product of the 70's and have made many mistakes.  I think it matters that you teach your children to be the best they can be at whatever they do!
FALSE,I personally just don't want my kid to get shot knifed or be surrounded by drugs everyday.	
FALSE,Parents DO invest in public schools-they pay Property Taxes and STILL pay tuition on top of that. Maybe if the tax money was used for education rather than administration the schools would be better off. 	
TRUE,I think it's a lousy article and the writer is completely wrong she needs to get to know all the parents that had there children go to private school before she starts to judge all private school parents by saying they are bad people. Most people send there kids to private school because of there religion for example catholic schools. How can you be a bad person when your just trying to send your kid to a school where he/she can learn about the Lord go to church and at the same time get a great education. Put that in your article Allison! 	
FALSE,"This is liberalism taken to another level!  Since all of us (including the ""wealthy"" parents who pay to send their kids somewhere else) are paying the teachers and administrators' salaries in these crappy schools with our tax dollars do you think that it might just be reasonable for us to ask them to do their job and clean it up themselves??  Now our enlightened friends at MSNBC are suggesting that its up to ""wealthy"" parents to do it instead??   How about changing the teacher's union rules so they get paid for performance like everybody else?  And if its a problem with the caliber of the student then lets start a discussion about family values and single Moms and deadbeat Dads who keep having children who they don't care about enough to raise them properly.  Al and Jesse are not interested in talking about that.  Teachers don't have to be incompetent and children who come from families who aren't ""wealthy"" don't have to have bad behavior and zero motivation.   How about an article on the cultural problem all of you ""progressive"" thinkers? 	"
TRUE,If you can afford it why not give your kids a great start in life and give the country a good supply of well educated leaders of government and industry.  This is just class envy.  I was a public school teacher.  Great gifted students do not lift up the quality of the school.  Gifted teachers do.  It is unfair to expect gifted students to slow themselves down for the benefit of others.  Let them go where they can rich full potential. 	
FALSE,No matter how you try to argue this....there will be people one side or other.  I live in a district with excellent public schools and we still send our children to a private school.  Neither the private or public school is without positives and negatives.  Parenting begins at home with the schools being an aid in the parenting process.   If you don't want to take responsibility for every aspect of your child's life then what happens then the job of the public or private educator becomes increasingly harder and more expensive. 	
FALSE,A more moronic article has never bee written.	
TRUE,Our local school district is good up through elementary. After that it is unsafe and the teachers are constantly telling me they are afraid of the students. Both of my children went to public school until middle school then went to private. Most school districts have pay scales so the argument about the best teachers make more money is hogwash. Show me the stats for public school college acceptance and good private school education. The people who can afford private schools and keep their child in public are not putting money into the system. They are just selfish. My opinion only. 	
TRUE,"Putting our children into a bad system to improve it is like buying a bad car from a company that is in trouble for it's quality problems.  You get a bad car to drive and no guarantee that you have helped the company.   YES we need to improve the public system.  NO I will not subject my child to a bad education to a system that has done everything wrong for the last 30 years.  Instead of fixing the problem of what to teach we have a governing body that wanted to add class hours to an already bad system.  So now our kids are exposed to more bad teaching.  My son benefited from sacrifice that affected me and the wife into our retirement. We have no regrets as he is now trying to ""fix"" the problem from the inside by teaching in public schools.  The competition that private schools give to public will only improve the latter.  Miss Benidikt makes the statement that ""you want the best for your child but your child doesn't need it"".  That is the kind of thinking the Chinese and Indian culture is hoping you will continue so"
FALSE,"Kristin Wong wrote ""her reasoning is compelling.""  Exactly who is compelled by the argument that the parents of children in crappy schools will somehow bring these lame schools up to par simply by having their children attend them? 	"
TRUE,Sad that someone would actually post this.  In many parts of this country it's the bad parents that don't care about their children education or support the teachers that  make public schools so bad and drive hard working people to work two jobs so they can afford to send their children to better schools. Where teachers can focus on teaching rather than riot control and less time to help struggling kids or kids that excel.   Best way to improve education is to attach tax dollars to students which drives competition to attract students and provide schools to meet different learning needs.  20/20 did a piece on Education in the US that says it all.  Some European schools do this very thing at elementary level and their students test years ahead of US schools.  We do fund college students with money to the student and they choose the best schools why not at lower levels?
FALSE,What a stupid question and waste of time this article is.  The United States is a free world...for now...and whose business is it to say it is wrong for the wealthy to send their kids to a private school.  That is the problem with our country too many busy bodies....mind your own business and the wealthy can do whatever they wish with their money.  I am not wealthy actually not even middle class any longer and I still agree citizens can do what they want with their money and everyone else should back off. 	
TRUE,"author=""Timaree""> My daughter has home schooled some of her kids in California. The curriculum if from the school district and they check in once a week for tests new lessons and guidance. This gives a lot of the good from both sides. The bad part is the homeschoolers have to complete more work than school educated kids and they don't get time off for all the holidays having to still turn all the work in on schedule. The kids still take all the state tests and are doing fine on them. But this has allowed for personality disability and scheduling differences which is good and still ensures they get a decent education. 	"
TRUE,I have two children.  My daughter who is a Junior attends public school and my son who is a Sophomore is in his first year at private school. Every child is different and their needs are different. My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her.  She excels in public school.  My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3.8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes.  He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do.  Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions.  Yes private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do.  My husband and I both work and make good money but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget.  We are making it work and I can tell you that I have seen a 100% difference in him.  He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids.  We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him.  I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now.  At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually.
FALSE,The money for public schools ALWAYS disappears these politicians are full of $hit. Next we can talk about the element in a lot of these schools 	
FALSE,This author would have been better served to write about the hypocrisy of liberal politicians sending their own kids to private schools while telling everyone else that public schools are the solution. Classic do as I say not as I do. 	
FALSE,Compelling?  No.  Allison Benedikt's arguments are fragile and flawed.  Really compelling and accurate are the arguments expressed in the various comments posted hereon some of which reflect mine. If we gave credence to Benedikt's arguments then executive officials members of Congress and of the judiciary who are parents too  should be required to send their children to public schools.

TRUE,As long as the teahers union runs public schools private schools are the only way to go	
FALSE,"This is a topic which has received a lot probably too much of my consciousness the last four years--basically since my oldest was a year old.  I went to a private parochial school that had 200 kids from K-8. I then attended a publicly funded high school (my parents gave us all a choice during the transition from elementary to high school).  I experienced a huge culture shock!  I went from a pool of essentially all white middle to middle-upper class kids to an ocean of every demographic and culture conceivable.  My grades suffered and so did my self image.  Had my primary education been different in a few regards--namely more exposure to those of diverse backgrounds and varying capabilities I think I really would have been a better balanced person able to handle the huge dynamics of a public high school. To Jamondown if anything private schools are highly traditional and convergent in pedagogy.  Variation from the curriculum is typically not tolerated. While a side of me appreciates your cynicism I don't think you really touch the surface of this contentious issue.   After much deliberation my husband and I decided to get our child into a publicly funded magnet program in our home town.  We had to put his name in a lottery and then bite our nails because he had a 1	""3 chance of getting in.  The reason we chose this route is because 1) our district school had below national average scores an indicator to me that there is a high level of variability in the classroom most likely due to having high percentage of ESL students 2) tuition costs would be hefty for all three of our children (average annual is $3-4k) and 3) we know that he's getting the love support cultural exposure and intellectual challenge at home. So our oldest is going to a public magnet (which incidentally emerged in our home town after de-segregation as a way to continue the cultural division) and our twins are currently in a public montessori pre-school with intentions to begin kindergarten at the magnet school once old enough.   I intend to be fully active in the PTA and every aspect of my children's lives as they go through their education AND we'll have $12000 left in pocket to spend on furthering their educational and cultural enrichment.

FALSE,Parents who send their children to a private school are not doing the public school system a diservice; they are doing a disservice to their children!  The same for parents who send their children to a public school. It is the parents responsibility to educate their child(ren); not that of strangers. Throughout the centuries it became the norm to send children off to that hellish institution (more commonly referred to as public or private school) so both parents could work (How else could a family afford two luxury sedans and an annual family vacation?).  Let's face it most parents I know (and many has testified to the fact) can't stand being around their own children all day so  ..........be thee child off to the school and give us no lip!  Yeahhhh I'm thinking end times and Children of the Corn! 	
FALSE,I have no problem with public education just government run schools.  Why can't the government pay for an education and let the parents pick the school they want their kids to go to.

TRUE,"This statement...“There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school” Benedikt wrote....is absolutely a lie! Bad people...Give Me A Break! I think it is a very loving thing a good and decent thing to send children to a private school! Do we still not live in the free United States of America??? I would like to say that the programs that the public schools are pushing are ""bad"" and teaching children to become more dependant upon our government where private schools teach self responsibility and good character...how dare this person call us bad if we chose to use our private schools...as a parent of a terrific private school system...I know we all have to work extra hard to keep these private schools running and that is also teaching our children persistence...and how to care for one another without depending on Uncle Sam to come in and pick up the pieces...are you kidding me by judging all parents who know and believe in a Higher Power than themselves...now that is a refreshing statement for Ms. Benedikt to mull over along with all of her secular ideas that the public school system is pumping into our children. You say she has a compelling argument...I say ""NOT""! 	"
TRUE,"I try not to be anti-homeschooling but... it's just hard for me. I really haven't met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right including myself.

""I have a friend who is 16 the same age as me. She has never watched a PG-13 movie. She has never been on the internet. She only reads books that her parents pick out for her. She is not allowed to go outside by herself. She is not allowed to listen to non-religious music. She has no idea how people get pregnant. She acts younger than her age and I often find that in order to get along with her I have to act less mature as well. Now I understand her parents' point of view. Not everything in the media is okay. Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous. But she's not a child anymore she's going to legally be an adult in two years and she does not understand the world at all. Yeah the world is a pretty suckish place and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it. But if you're going to survive in it you have to know what you're up against. I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about and she's going to suffer because of it. ""	""I know my friend's case is rather extreme but the thing is... the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues. Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents and many of them to be honest act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders. They just don't understand the world. They just don't get it. Yes they socialize with other people - but those people are other white right-winged heterosexual Christians. To this day I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn't fit that criteria (ironically enough since I'm a left-winged pansexual atheist). Why? Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child. ""	""Again I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way.

My tax dollars already go to fund public schools so I am not shirking a financial obligation when choosing private school. Sending my child to an underperforming school does not maximize his chances to succeed even with my active participation.  Thus I am reducing his opportunities for a pipe dream.

Everything is broken in that school and it is not  going to change overnight or in 3 years. In addition people are mobile and may not own a home in the community and do not see it worth their time to invest in making changes happen.

TRUE,"This article is a joke.  Are you serious?  Public schools are a disaster.  I would know my mom was a public school teacher in a middle class school.  My parents sent me to a Catholic school.

I learned discipline good study habits morals a good work ethic in the Catholic school I attended.  I also learned to have an appreciation of life long learning.

FALSE,Surely this isn't real; this is the most mindless crap I’ve read in a long time.	
FALSE,"What she says is probably true. The more affluent parents would probably make the public school ""less crappy"". But why should they be expected to submit their children to a ""less crappy"" school when they can have a good school. Of course if you believe in communism then everyone should be required to endure ""less crappy"" schools which would consistently degenerate into full fledged ""crappy""! 	"
TRUE,What nonsense. Every responsible parent wants the best education possible for their children. Why is it 'bad' for parents to send their children to a private school where they will get the best possible education instead of sending them to a failing public school in 'hopes' that it will make the school better? The author is suffering from 'Liberal Dementia'. 	
TRUE,Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly.  Values can be promoted in accordance with the client population's choice.  We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools especially in the contemporary religious environment.    Ms Wong is really the bad person here because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students.  That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to. 	
FALSE,The writer is either absolutely clueless or just a ignorant socialist.	
TRUE,I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education. She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic. The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math. This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies. Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class? Give me a break!
TRUE,Choice is what would make the system better.  Public schools are so bureaucratic they don't know what they are doing.  Private schools survive because they are better than public schools.  If everyone was allowed to take there public schools dollars and use them on whatever school they want you would see all schools get more efficient and educate better. 	
FALSE,In my case homeschooling. I guess it down to the person and there situ. I don't have a choice other than to at the moment. I've been in normal school most of my life though so I don't know... 	
TRUE,"Yes but...   I taught in public schools for 12 years because I believe in the idea of a free and democratic education. In reality public schools are a quagmire of small-town politics and administrators trying to get ahead; in the current iteration they have nothing to do with what is best for kids and everything to do with getting one's name on the top of the letterhead. I tried for 12 years to change this and failed. My kid languishing in a ""good"" public school was getting stupid and lazy. I quit started my own school and now I see her thrive every day.   The whole mission of public school needs to change and for that to happen minds need to change and there are just too many people out there who believe worksheets and standardized testing are the way to go. Until that mindset shifts public school won't change regardless of how many wealthy parents come back. It's not just about money."
TRUE,"I went to private school in ""the hood"" in Los Angeles.  I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego.  Private school wins no matter where you go.  Why? Children are taught not only the mandatory curriculum but also how to be considerate disciplined and respectful. Granted this should be taught at home.  But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you're teaching them at home and they're being supervised at all times and they're getting a good education how does that not make sense? In the future should I have children  they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools K-12 just as I was."
TRUE,"CRAP!!!  If you can afford to send your kids to  a good private school by all means do so. ""Education Experts"" have pretty much ruined the Public School System so if you can avoid it you should. The sad truth is...   Those who can do. Those who can't teach. And those incapable of teaching become ""Education Experts"". 	"
TRUE,Wong states “Your local school stinks and you do send your child there? I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better.” But he must know this is not at all true ... parents may complain but few are doing everything or even anything within their power to make it better.  Many many parents object to curriculum choices and emphasis on a social progressive agenda that will not change no matter how much involved they may be. Many object to the outrageous salaries paid to administrators or to the number of administrators but there is consistently nothing done to curb that - and when a school districts budget is voted down they either retake the vote to get a better result or put a 'contingency budget' in place that may actually be higher than the original budget ... it is time to end this system and if I were a parent today I would do everything in my power to get my child out of the public schools! 	
FALSE,Maybe your right but it is not a risk I'm willing to take. My child will suffer and or fall behind while I'm fighting the system. I'll just have to be a bad parent that pays taxes so that the other children can benefit from public school education or not meanwhile my child's chances of success are higher with minimal risk of failing schools. 	
TRUE,In public school I learned everything I needed to graduate in about 10th grade. The last few years where a joke. Same english class over and over again hey I can read a book and write a report on it. How many times do I have to do this? Go to college and the first thing I do is take english read a book and write a report. Why waste time and money so much is useless at school these days.
FALSE,So sad that my kids missed out on how to put a condom on a banana.........they also didn't get any diversity training nor lessons on tolerance.......However they did learn reading writing and arithmetic........imagine that 	) 
FALSE,not Private school but home school....they have no protection	
FALSE,Well at least this article was written with an open mind and not the least bit biased.	
TRUE,"The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student the parent and the environment they live in. I did ten and a half years of public school and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool. I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me. Yes I succeeded in school and was generally an A student but that was mostly because I'm naturally intelligent and capable. I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat I was making too much noise I was disturbing the other kids etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame. In middle school I was severely bullied and isolated. That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade and between that and the ADHD I couldn't handle public school anymore and switched out. I had some great teachers I had good grades and I had a small handful of friends but ultimately public school did not work for me. 	""Yes I face social barriers now but honestly I'm just as awkward as I was in public school. I have trouble with self motivation sometimes and take lots of breaks but I always get all of my schoolwork done. I have many resources available to me my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma and I'm about to start working on university applications. ""	Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn't do anything secular or know anything about the real world. They have since then transitioned into public schools and (from my distant vantage point) seem to be doing fine. They're very socially capable and seem to be average teenagers. 	""I don't think that the big school model is very effective. Children and teenagers can learn more from an education that is personalized supportive and based on learning and self satisfaction opposed to test scores and school funding. Unfortunately we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool. If I have kids I will probably homeschool them because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing. ""	"
TRUE,"I think this writer is flat wrong.  We had our kids in public schools for years and went to the school board meetings etc. etc.  From what I have seen the school boards have an attitude that parents are a problem and the board and the NEA knows what is best for our kids.  I have seen a packed house meeting with all parents advocating against a policy and then they go ahead and vote for the policy anyway.  It's a joke to think that just because wealthy parents send kids there it will be different.  There are always some exceptions but generally the school boards and teachers get their marching orders from the NEA....parents are only given the ""illusion"" of participation in the process. 	"
TRUE,Well the Federal Government got involved and that is what has ruined schools.  Also school has dumbed down since I went.  Now the government is talking about kids being obese so we have to have health food.  Its not so much what they eat as much as what they do! When I was in grade school we had Recess in the morning then lunch at noon and after we ate we were taken out side and walked around the baseball field.  Then we had P.E and did some kind of activity.  Now days they do not do as much activity at school or at home.  Now days kids want to sit and play xbox Nintendo computers ipads or ipods or ride four wheelers when they should be out playing or riding bicycles.  I part yea parents need to take an active role in their child's health and education but if the school fails to sucks then let them put them in private school.  My child goes to public school and if the school starts to suck then guess what I'll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can't fix stupid! 	
TRUE,"I feel like homeschooling depends particularly on the parents who will be teaching. I find it very difficult to imagine being homeschooled but that might also be because I don't know anyone who is homeschooled. In my country parents can only homeschool their child if he or she has a mental or physical disability or the parents don't agree with the worldview (christian atheist whatever) of any school within a reasonable distance to their home. In short the government doesn't allow homeschooling except in special circumstances. 	""I think that there are advantages and negatives to both homeschooling and public schools. But in general I have found the elementary and secondary school model in my country pretty good and comfortable. Obviously schools have certified teachers who have to meet certain standards (though some horrible teachers slip through sometimes) and homeschooling doesn't have that but on the other hand parents know their children much better than any teacher will so the education can be more focused on the needs of the student. ""	""Ultimately I cannot say one is better than the other because I've always went to public schools and they have always suited me well (regardless of some annoying teens). I have never experienced homeschooling and don't know anyone who has so i can't say to much about it ""	) "
TRUE,It is impossible to fire a bad public school teacher.   Fix this before you start telling folk they are bad for caring about kids. 	
TRUE,From an economic point of view public schools are free and private schools are quite expensive. If someone was selling something in the marketplace for $5000 and someone else was giving it away for free and the person giving away their product for free couldn't compete what does that tell you about their product?
FALSE,no although the school in money areas are way better in everyway this is one of the perks of achieving success 	
TRUE,I'll send my kid to private school thanks. It has nothing to do with prestige or family tradition. I just want him to have the best education he can get.   Fixing the broken public school system from within will never work because you will only be one voice among the many who could care less about the quality of the education provided as long as the school keeps providing what amounts to free childcare during the day. 	
TRUE,It is wrong to send a child to government schools. Education is far too important to let the government do it. 	
FALSE,Everyone invests in the public school system - even those who never have kids & renters - It's called TAXES.   (In the case of renters landlords pass on the cost via the rent they charge.) 	
TRUE,Socialism 101 - everyone must have everything the same. Those that work hard to be successful and have a better life do not deserve to reap the rewards of that success - they must share it with everyone. Sorry that's not the principles this once great country was founded on and it does not foster ambition in anyone. Why work hard if you have to give most of it away to those who choose not to.   And perhaps more people should worry about the liberal indoctrination of our children in the public school system. If that were not a very real danger then more people would consider sending their children to the cesspool that is now our public school system. Besides private school should not be anyone's worry - it is home schooling that is becoming the trend. People who care about their children and our country are realizing it is parents' job to teach and raise children - not daycare and the government sanctioned liberal indoctrination warehouses you people try to pass off as education.
TRUE,This bitch needs to shut the hell up! So if you live in a area where the public school system is a joke and the best way to give your children the best education possible is private school. Then hell yeah Im going to do it! 	
TRUE,So I am now expected to sacrifice an  education for my child so that possibly other children in 25 years can have a better education? No thanks I will continue to sacrifice so that MY child gets the most that HE can get. I still pay my taxes and I still pay for the school system. I am guessing the author does not have a child.
FALSE,That's right only wealthy parents send their kids to private school.	
TRUE,My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8. Best decision they ever made. I was ahead of my peers by high school. My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school. My kids attend public school now and I detest it. Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively. They can't bring home their books so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they've learned in school. In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn't assign homework because the kids didn't do it anyway...WHAT? So reward the bad behavior?? I also don't agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things. I think it sends the wrong message. The kids are coddled have no responsibility with the school system in this area. It drives me nuts.
TRUE,"That is by far the most convoluted line of reasoning I have ever heard.  Very short sighted and downright foolish.  GONE are the days of parent controlled school boards where parents actually have a say in what occurs in schools.  Our local public school just sent a letter to incoming Kindy parents ""please do not attempt to engage the teacher in conversation"" ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!.  Parents are not even allowed in the building.  Good luck trying to make reforms.  I for one don't believe in public education at all.  HA!  Contrary to the premises of this article maybe we should scrap the entire ""crappy"" public school system. 	"

As a teacher I can verify that you have hit the nail well and truly on the head Tony. That is exactly how it is! 	""Frankly I can't believe you have said these words out loud. You really want your child surrounded by other children from """"middle class to lower-middle class families"""" ... good grief. Hate to tell you this but they don't have that option when they go to work sit on public transport attend a public hospital etc etc. At a guess I imagine your child attends a private school with 'strong christian values' ... slightly ironic given your attitude to anyone not fitting into your acceptable social sphere. ""	""Unlike most people I had one child attend a very elite private school in Sydney (via a scholarship) and another attend a comprehensive state high school in the western suburbs so I speak from experience. They both received the same education and were taught by equally competent teachers. Both have equally nice friends. Yes the private school was undoubtedly better resourced but my impression was a lot of money was spent on aesthetics e.g. gardens cleaning windows every 5 minutes maintaining sporting fields etc. ""	""The belief that a private school gives your child a more rounded education is a fallacy if anything it is the opposite. Students from these elite private schools live a bubble existence. Families are expected to live their lives through the school. They only play sport against a handful of other private schools.

""Unless of course the """"feral"""" parents have more money than you in which case the private school tolerates them easily. I know too many people who were sent to private schools and had to tolerate all sorts of disruptive anti-social violent behaviour from other students because all the private school cared about was money. Even academic performance was a distant priority if your kid wasn't one of the stars or pets.

""	Disagree - the perceived 'old boys club' is quickly surpassed once a university education is backed up with experience overseas. The grubs I had the pleasure of dealing with in a sub-par government school were the perfect training for the bullying and general psychopaths that exist at the pinnacle of a finance career. 	I truly feel for parents who place their children in expensive education only to be managed out during the later years due to non-performance which would adversely affect the schools statistics. I also feel for the children who feel they have been invested in and need to provide a return on investment for their parents' efforts - have seen sad examples of both.... 	Bang on. Correct. Well said.	""Debate about public versus private tends to focus upon the """"fantastic"""" public education available proponents happily deciding to sweep the lack of quality public education that exists in some areas in particular regional areas where there may be only one public secondary school within reach. Private schools in the same areas do not tend to have the high fees and facilities a very very small number of private schools have yet if you are making an argument I guess examining the truth and justifying sending your children to schools with poor results and facilities could be a downfall... To those denigarating the """"riff raff"""" at Government schools with four children I am left with little financial choice about where my children go regardless of my values however I can assure you there are a lot of """"cashed up bogans"""" at private schools these days who simply like to believe a private school is a status symbol rather than actually valuing education at all. Perhaps if you ask your children's contemporaries for their parents' resumes you could further cull your list of """"appropriate"""" contemporaries. ""	""While I understand your point a little there are just as many social issues for your child to deal with no matter what school they go to (or what uni they attend what workplace they work in etc). Class snobbery exists in all schools and even the wealthy breed wayward children who disregard others and will happily take them down the path of destruction with them. It is just hidden more behind the smart uniforms manicured gardens and glossy brochures. The best grounding for your children is you the parent. Your child's education and future is best directed from home and I don't see that the choice of school necessarily surpasses this. Your child's choice of friends is also something that should be directed from home by encouraging healthy friendships with children of similar interests temperament personality and discouraging unhealthy friendships with children that are bullying controlling nasty or ringleaders of misery - irrespective of the families backgrounds. These kids are in all schools and probably in equal proportions. ""	""So how does anyone explain the trams full of ill-mannered boys and girls going to and from Melbourne Grammar Wesley College etc?

It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

FALSE,"Same old class warfare article. Why don't you focus your attention on what can be done to improve the public system and perhaps you'll see kids go back.

TRUE,"There is no secret to the rise of private schools. I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have1. More resources 2.

""Naturally if a school has the power to select and expel students at will it's easier teaching there.

FALSE,Dont ask pollies about their educational upbringing or even the boffins who have studied this from afar. How about finding out whats wrong with the public model from those who are intimate with it. The teachers themselves. Too many teachers in the public system are sending their children to private schools for this to be merely a class issue or being duped with flashy marketing. Theirs is probably the most informed choice of all yet we continue to have water cooler style debates based on one eyed perceptions. We may think that we are all experts on education because we ourselves attended school but the public discourse on this topic has not really heard from those truly in the know. 	
FALSE,Private or public you make a choice. But to live in a society that we aspire to a good education for everyone is the foundation. A better public system is what we need so that those who cannot afford private education at least have a chance. And that requires more funding in the public sector. 	
TRUE,Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way.. My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children's education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system .. Sports on Saturdays music classes drama classes etc the catholic school that's says 95% is reflecting their area .. The dearest private schools with long heritage of generations of pupils from the one family don't show it theses days ... Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children's education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be
TRUE,"Out of step with the Swedes? Prior to the 1990s there were only a handful of private schools in Sweden mostly tuition-funded boarding schools whereof Sigtunaskolan and Lundsbergs skola are the most well known. A major education reform in 1992 allowed privately run schools offering primary or secondary education to receive public funding for each student at a level similar to what public schools receive. These are called ""free schools"" (friskolor) and in 2008 there were around 900 of them. 	""You forgot to mention that the free schools in Sweden are exactly that free. They can not charge fees of any kind and the only money they receive is via the childs voucher. ""	""I have lived in Sweden and I I can tell you that the reality of the Swedish free school system is that the """"private"""" schools are not as good. They have less teachers they teach subjects that differ in some respects from state syllabus and are in many instances are Islamic or religious in nature. ""	Many new immigrants to Sweden were refusing to send their children to state schools and the introduction of the friskolor was to help with that issue. 	You also forgot to mention that the largest free school operator in Sweden is shutting its doors because it has gone broke and the Swedish government is thinking of doing away with the whole thing and going back to a well integrated state system for all. 	You also forgot to mention that private schools for the rich in Sweden receive zero funding.	You left out a bit of the quote from Wikipedia that you used about Sweden. It goes something like this	"" """"they are not allowed to discriminate or require admission examinations nor are they allowed to charge the students any additional fees.""""

The problem for you lot today is that the internet allows others to discover your falsehoods and misrepresentations immediately they are committed. """"The international comparisons aren't really comparable. For instance what the 7% figure for kids educated in private schools in the UK doesn't mention is the fact that England at least still has quite a large number of selective grammar schools - so if you're academically inclined the public system can still cater for you and give you a high quality education amongst a similarly focused peer group. Really all the Australian figures indicate is that parents don't trust the Australian public school system to educate their kids because it's too worried about being egalitarian and non-competitive (at the same time as becoming more and more under-resourced as fewer people opt to use it). ""	""No The reason they choose it is to give their own child an educational advantage that is not related to their academic competence and that will enable them to join the upper class. The thing I find amusing about the Conservatives is the blatantly obvious ploy they use to divert attention from the fact that they are re-created and re-enforcing the class system by their choice of education for their children by screaming that the rest of us are obsessed with class when we point out that is what they are doing.

In Australia if you want a Catholic education then you are forced to go private - but this is not the case in the UK and perhaps if it were the case their privately educated figures would go up?

TRUE,You have to be very careful comparing Australia to the UK and USA. Here we have a parallel public system called systemic Catholic schools - they are low fee charging and widespread across the suburbs - they are not really elitist private schools and when you factor in them to the mix the figures in private are not that different. 	The best schools for academic achievement are selective state schools - they don't get the unruly kids and they don't get the thick kids whose parents have to pay a lot of money for them to be coached through private school and then use their connections to get a job when they can't do it from their own abilities. 	
FALSE,Eventually we will have a complete user pays educational system. Children from families who can`t afford the exorbitant fees of the best performing schools will receive a mediocre education. 	
TRUE,I have been a long term defender of public education - although fortunately have the advantage of living in a higher SES area where the public schools are relatively well resourced. Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn't have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls. Also while academic standards were high it was very much a 'survival of the fittest' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter. We are finding the Catholic school much kinder and more supportive on the whole and also surprisingly stronger on things like social justice and inclusion of students with disabilities and that type of thing. 	
TRUE,"I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn't exist. It all depends on the person. I went to public school and was in every club president of some and also was in the Student Body Presidency. Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people. This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion not because im a strong leader. At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college. I've never done regular homeschooling though. So I don't have grounds on it. But I live in a community that could be considered a little rednecked and the extremes are a little more common here. But hey my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 which I'm not anyore but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school I don't know. Where you could study the World in Highschool I might spend two years just to get an overview of the United States History in college.

FALSE,The politics of envy?	I think it's a question of perspective. You could view the private vs public in elitist privileged class terms or you could view it as a healthy sign that a significant proportion of Australians think that the public education is under resourced. 	They choose to resource the education of their children at a higher level than the state thinks is adequate - thus as a society we are shown as valuing education higher than our oft quoted OECD rivals. 	Of course the rise in the influence of religion in the education sector of our otherwise secular society is another question. 	
TRUE,I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education.

TRUE,The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher. It was said that a 'voucher system' would eventually be put in place where by the funding attached to each student would 'travel' with the student. This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community. As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of 'schools of last resort'. Later as a parent I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand. Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private. I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system. I couldn't abide that my own values of respect cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system. The teachers in both systems are the same but the expectations of the parents are simply different. I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for!

But here are my reasons""""1.) The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents. Children are not owned by the government and the government cannot tell people how to raise their children. Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree but this is what I believe. Ideological reasons for homeschooling are in my opinion completely legitimate. ""	""2.) Every child is different. I see a lot of you on both sides saying this too. Homeschooling allows you to tailor your education to whatever way helps you learn best. My school has a heavy focus on writing and using essays. This really helps me retain the information and so it's wonderful for me. Other schools have other methods. But when you put 30 kids in one classroom it becomes very difficult to teach them all individually. ""	""3.) The public school system in most places is out of control. I know some of you are saying """"Well in MY public school they didn't...."""" and that's great. Maybe for the people who live in that neighborhood homeschooling isn't the better option. But I had to go to my local public school to take the PSAT and someone was getting arrested as we were leaving. So in some cases there's a safety issue. In other places it's what kids will hear and I'm not talking about peers. This isn't the place to argue about Planned Parenthood but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn't be said without a parent's permission. Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying and failing a lot of other things too. ""	4.) You don't have as much busywork. I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences. Kids have too much homework; no one I know who goes to school gets enough sleep. 	""5.) There are exceptions to this but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers""	"" you get healthier socialization! I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events. There are such things as homeschool groups and we get together just for the purpose of socializing. Plus you're exposed to a wider age range when you're homeschooled.

I could go on forever but I won't. Healthy wonderful people can come out of any education; same for unhealthy people. I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes; and I know some AWESOME WONDERFUL people who go to public school.

FALSE,Having taught for many years in both State and Catholic schools in not so salubrious suburbs I would make the distinction between the local systemic Catholic school and Private schools which charge exhorbitant fees. Fees at systemic schools are set by the system and vary little. I have not had many wealthy children in my classes. By the way teachers are all taught in the same institutions its the way all schools are run and how much time and effort parents put into their children's education that counts.

TRUE,"I never intended sending my sons to a private school but having got elected to my local primary school council and been immersed in the curriculum review process it was clear that there was a huge miss match between the idealistic educational model the resources quality of teachers (most then worn out) and the many problems of many students requiring attention to basic skills. Moved to private system which has same lofty aspirations but they cull out the students/families they do not want have better age/gender balance and have slightly better resources. We were told one of our sons was ""a bit slow"" by his Year 2 teacher and not to expect too much. He won school prizes for 3 out of 5 subjects in Year 12 at a highly regarded private school. It is important to note that class sizes are similar in most private schools with better curriculum and less problems with students/parents making life simpler for parents. Unfortunately parents I speak to recently have same or worse experiences with public school system. Teachers I know who have moved from public to private are amazed at how much easier teaching is because the school is able to insist on basic standards of behaviour and doing things like homework. I think Sally Young needs to talk to a few parents who decided to switch to find out the reason is more pathetic performance of our public school system despite massive increase in funding over the decades. 	Another dose of honesty! But who is this 'miss match'?"
TRUE,"Are there any statistics on privately and publicly educated students being accepted to Australia's top universities? I went to a state school for the first 3 years of high school where I recall not much of my education there- it was mostly ""Australian"". Then my parents moved me to an all-girls catholic school (I was being bullied at the public school) where the value of education was much higher academic achievements were celebrated and we had motivational speakers regularly. I'm sure that socially I would have stayed the same had I stated at the state school but not academically."
TRUE,"Thanks for an entertaining very timely infomercial for conservative state governments. Our kids attended state schools and excelled one to doctoral level. They did comment that private school students at their university experienced more difficulty than state school educated kids... and research indicates that coddled spoon-fed learners have trouble coping when that silver spoon disappears... . 	""SV that reflects my personal experience of teaching matriculation courses in TAFE. About 80% of the time you could pick the private school repeats who immediately asked 'what's the answer?' rather than 'how can we work it out?' As always there were honourable exceptions. """
FALSE,Let's not beat about the bush people. When our eldest started at a state high school this year many of our primary school parent friends were horrified. And although they would always check who was listening before saying so their primary concern was that there would be too many Asians there. And it was the same regardless of whether they were left or right of centre with their politics. 	
TRUE,"I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more. There's plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them (ie. more time at home less time at work) and make their home life an enriching one. This is not about real ""choice"". When middle-class parents go private they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor. I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in. To me learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit. 	""How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to.Attitude to studies is all important.If a student's mind is occupied with sex drugs and alcohol you can't expect good results. Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won't matter which school he/she attends.Education for life is not solely the job of teachers it starts at home in the child's earliest years.Parents should lead by example. ""	"
TRUE,Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school. On the school board etc. If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background. The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored. They need to bring back classes where all children's needs are met not just the worst behaved why should the whole class be punished because one child's behaviour. Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade. They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students. In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed. We left and went from bored hating school children to excited about learning keen to get to school enthused again. Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school. Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools.
TRUE,I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test. They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing I think that's a good thing. My problem is when a parent doesn't put the effort in to socialize the kids they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group. 	
FALSE,That's what I see in my homeschooled gk's. I don't have an issue with homeschooling but think they should be allowed to play with the local kids that don't go to thier church play community sports and such. I worries me but yes I do keep my mouth shut some times it's kind of hard when your having a conversation with gs who mentions he'd like to try playing soccer. 	
TRUE,"Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse. It can ruin your child's whole life. 	Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school. There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education.

FALSE,"My kids went to public school took AP classes (college courses) and both graduated in the top 10% of their class. My son went on to get his engineering degree.

TRUE,"I'm on the same page as FedUp. My kids won't go to public schools for a lot of reasons. We do have a lot of private schools around us we are starting to look into the cost as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it. I agree that HS isn't what it used to be there are a lot more resources. I don't know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized so much as motivated. (though organization does help.) I've known people who were HS where their parents didn't really teach them all that much. I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school and it is really easy to be like ""Well we'll get back on track tomorrow."" A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board."
FALSE,BEG	Your girls seem very self motivated. Do you think your opinion would change if they weren't?	I had boys. I felt they needed some pushing. I think (generally speaking) girls are more motivated academically than boys. There was a 5	1 ratio of girls vs boys in National Honor Society \.
FALSE,"Skipped you bring up a good point. During my studies of multiple intelligence theory boys were talked about extensively because our current public school system is not always necessarily directed based on young male or children with different learning styles needs. Right now the majority of schools curriculum & learning styles are set up for little girls who can sit at their desk for long periods of time. Which is not easy for a lot of boys. 	""There is a lot of talk about changing the way we teach I don't think it'll happen any time soon. But I think the prospect of using MI Theory for all children will eliminate a lot of children falling through the cracks & at the same time promote their individual strengths and develop a love of learning vs getting frustrated & throwing their hands up. ""	"
FALSE,"it's not about the rules per se...although the rules are an indication of the values that the school holds. For instance the public school in my hometown requires at least a 2 inch inseam where as the Christian school requires no more than 2 inches from kneecap....so the Christian school ""rule"" is more in line with a value of modesty whereas the public school value of ""please just don't show your crotch"" is demonstrated in the 2 inch inseam rule. 	""there are kids doing kids things no matter what school you go to. Just because kids are at a Christian school doesn't mean that you are totally avoiding drugs alcohol premarital sex...BUT...it is a totally different mindset from how it is approached by the school. Your kids are with their peers and teachers many more waking hours than they are with you....so I want the teachers and school to be promoting the same values and beliefs that we are at home. If they get caught up in something they are not supposed to be doing I want there to be more than just detention or suspension...I want there to be education from their teachers and maybe even Biblical counseling as to WHY we believe premarital sex is wrong or WHY it is important to obey the law...not just because it is the law but based on Biblical principals.

TRUE,"I still want to homeschool. I can make subjects come alive in a way that simply isn't possible within the physical confines of a classroom regardless of how great the teachers or curriculum are. 	I really dislike the amount of time wasted in school.	""I really really dislike the emphasis on conformity which happens regardless of curriculum.""	""And with the emphasis on standardized testing and focus on the scoring of regurgitated information I'm not sure a curriculum I would like exists even hypothetically. ""	"
FALSE,"Our kids went to a private Christian School K-12 while they missed some of the opportunities the kids at the larger public school had as in learning Chinese and a few AP classes they both got good educations. The one thing that stayed with me through the years is when our Headmaster told us that in a smaller school you at least ""knew who the bad guys are"" that is so true. By being involved in the school board and on the PTA and just being there I pretty much knew who I did and did not want my kids hanging out with not to mention who I did and did not want my kids at the parents home if a Mom comes to a PTA meeting sloppy drunk my child will not be spending the night at her house. 	""Testing is a mixed bag while I think so many teach to the test and skip over critical thinking skills the test do prepare for the ACT/SATs and that is still very important. Universities still do depend on these numbers for not only acceptance but for scholarships. A good ACT/SAT score can send a kid in our area through for 4 years full ride. So just knowing """"how"""" to test is important also. Our kids have always had really good test scores I think it was because they both had good reading comprehension I know a couple of their friends that I would consider """"smarter"""" than them but did not test as well because (IMO) they were not excellent readers and it took them longer to pick up what the test were asking.

TRUE,"I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling. I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education. Because I'm a much better ""learner"" than I am a ""teacher"" and admittingly I just don't have the patience that it requires. I can teach life skills w/ no problem. I can learn things for myself w/ little effort. But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned. 	""My boys have needed help w/ their homework at times and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today. Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves the only other con that I can see w/ homeschooling though is the socialization skills. I know there are other ways around it but to me the best way for kids to learn how to interact w/ their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn't necessarily always something interest-based like sports clubs playgrounds etc. but that's just me. ""	I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though (for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works) is that kids can learn at their own pace w/o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class.

FALSE,"BSW you've made some really good points about public school not being as *free* as it used to be and having to supplement the costs of some of these extracurricular activities. We've had to do that also and it was not as costly for my parents as it is for us w/ our kids. Whether some of it is because of the cost of living differences from when I was in school or whether it's because the activities just seem to need (or rather peer pressured into) more of the extras that kids have nowdays that maybe we didn't I'm not sure about. Could be a bit of both. But I do understand what you mean by your examples. 	""Here's the thing though...public education is not *free*. We as parents are paying for it through our tax dollars (and when my taxes come due every year the majority of that money goes towards school taxes more than anything else). Our public school system is not what I would consider a """"poor"""" school. Yet every single parent is given a list of """"school supplies"""" that needs to be supplied for the kids at our school...on that list it is specifically requested certain types of supplies that by the teachers request are on the high end of cost. Also things on this list of """"school supplies"""" are things like kleenex hand sanitizers toilet paper paper towels etc. To top that off our school district has voted in uniforms since my oldest was in 3rd or 4th grade. That's 2 sets of clothes that I have to buy for my kids every year...their regular clothes and their school uniforms. On average it costs somewhere around $1200 every year to just get my two younger kids started in public school between supplies and uniforms (that's not including costs for their everyday clothing) not counting the extras throughout the year for their extracurricular activities. There never was much of this kind of stuff for my parents to have to deal w/ when I was in school. ""	Side note	"" I voted against the uniforms and I have griped and complained every single year about it. The """"reasoning"""" was so that the poorer kids wouldn't be able to be singled out as easily by their clothing (generic vs. name brands) yet they have given us a basic guideline to go by for the uniforms which doesn't do anything to change what brought about the reasoning behind it. The wealthier kids still buy their polos & khaki's from places like Aeropostle & such while the poorer buy their polos & khaki's from Walmart & Dollar Stores. There's still the issue of name brand vs. generic and being able to tell the difference in the classes of wealthy or poor. All that the parents that voted this in have done is put more of a burden on the poorer families by requiring them to have to buy two different types of clothing for their children...the school could have at least given a standard requirement for uniforms like most private schools in our area do (here is where we order our uniforms from fill out your order and send it in to the school along w/ your money so we can process). But their reasoning for not doing that was because they wanted to try and keep the cost down as much as possible for the poorer families.

FALSE,"Sadly the best answer to the question of inclusion is ""it depends"". But that's what IEPs and teams are for. 	My youngest daughter got some WAY early intervention (she was in a Krieger study just after her second birthday) and because of that is in a normal pre-K class with some additional assistance here and there. But that's my daughter and her case; I can think of at least three or so of her earlier peers that might still not be set for such a task. 	""Is inclusion possible? Certainly. Is it the preferred option? For those crunching the numbers probably but not necessarily for the children and not necessarily for their parents. ""	"
FALSE,As a former teacher I didn't care if a parent chose to homeschool their child for any reason.

TRUE,forgot to add my son was very disruptive and dangerous alot of the time in mainstream because he couldn't cope. the teachers were not sufficiently trained to deal with him we were constantly called to the school to sort it out (when tbh we had no idea how either!) he was suspended more times than i remember and was only on half days! (which i've later discovered is actually illegal)...so no it wasn't fair on the other kids...not fair on him either. 	the government seem to think that making special needs kids go to mainstream will improve people's attitudes...it doesn't in my experience...they only did it to save money 	
TRUE,I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children. I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children. I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both. One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA's to children. The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit. They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times. Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made e.g IT provision in every lesson access to a scribe extended time to sit exams and submit homework leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors. I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips work experience careers etc. 	I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright. However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding. 	
FALSE,"maybe he is like dr jekyll and mr hyde	has SEN at school..needs lots of support	perfectly NT by the time he gets home...	i'm sure that is what most schools think lol.

TRUE,"Honestly? I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London. Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem a joy really and my job! BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly. A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD. A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD. 	""I wasn't equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he """"broke"""" really easily either and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life until the support got there. ""	""I don't think it works unless all classes are small (15 max) and all children with needs have one to one help. I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy as he would then """"blow"""" much to the amusement of everyone. I didn't feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons and when he was """"blowing"""" neither did anyone else.

FALSE,"My lo has mild autism he has only just been diagnosed he is delayed in some areas (but not others) he goes to ms school and has some one to one (this should increase now I hope). There is one TA and a full time TA who supports another child with autism. It's a smallish school.

TRUE,As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available. I am a teacher (currently SAHM) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD. For the majority of the children in the school mainstream would not have been a suitable placement. Many didn't speak at all had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting. Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources. No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it's a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN. In some cases inclusion can work fantastically well. My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school. The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class (with a known teaching assistant). They usually went in for sessions like Art where the difference in ability is less obvious. This worked really well. I think that where inclusion is being considered it has to be carefully planned to meet the childs needs. I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails. It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible.
FALSE,"Hi	I am wondering if this meeting will form part of her her Annual Review? If she has a statement then this type of meeting should take place to review support and make plans for the coming year. It is often the case that a range of professionals will be invited to an Annual Review. Many schools also access support from their local Outreach Team so this is not unusual but the parents whould be involved in this process so that ideas and suggestions can be carried out at home as well. 	""Specialist provision could be suggested if the school feel that they are unable to meet her needs anymore. If it is possible for them with support to continue the provision as it is then this should be considered as well. Many mainstream schools successfully support children with considerable additional needs as long as they are able to get the support levels right. It may mean that the school needs more training or needs to pull in more support but this is far from impossible. Your friend should also be asked for her views so it is worth thinking this through before the meeting.

FALSE,"Hi. We've not got to apply just yet as DS wont be starting until 2011 but due to him having autism and a couple of bad experiences previously in pre-school it's an area which concerns me greatly. 	""Firstly as I said we've had 2 very bad experiences in pre-schools before he started the one he is at now. Both resulted in huge regression because they both (though different from one another) blatently didn't know what they were doing and had no provisions in place. I spent a few nights reading through ofsted reports (the small bit about SENs) for all the local nurseries/playschools and googling for research... I eventually found the place DS is in now. It's brilliant and I can't praise them enough for the hard work they put in - though they don't expect it. ""	""Problem is that they are attached to a very very small school and we are not directly in the catchment area. I'm led to believe that though the first choices do go to those who live very close by DS will be OK in getting in there. I know I'm going to have to have these as my first choice. I want him in this school (mainstream btw) but if it doesn't work out (less understanding teacher cannot cope in another way etc etc) I was hoping that would be enough evidence for the LEA to prove that he needed to go to the local specialised school for autism (which also happens to be closer than the mainstream I am talking about.) but have recently found out that there is a long wait for the specialised school very long and we'd be offered a place at a different special school which is 1.5 hrs away. I wont allow that not for 3 hours of my son's day to be spent going back and to in a taxi! But I also am not willing to subject him to failing in a mainstream class and then having no option other than to continually watch him regress. ""	""Which then leads me to think that maybe I should apply and ask for him to go directly to special school? But I am warned if he still doesn't get a place then I could end up being refused a place in the only mainstream one I want him in which leaves me in an even bigger predicament!

FALSE,You will be able to voice your opinions and have input as parents with the LA as to why you think a particular school is suitable for your child.

FALSE,I understand how it feels to make a decision regarding mainstream or special needs schooling. Your post made me feel really sad. I have a son who is 8 with trisomy 21 Down syndrome and he is currently in mainstream and i too have held him back a year. I am lucky in that the children in my sons class are all very good with him and he does seem to be liked even though his behaviour can be quite challanging at time. However because i have held him back the children in his class are only 6 about to turn 7 so they are still quite young so that may or may not be why they are quite understanding and accepting of him . I have just made the decision to start my son in a special needs school from September as i really don't think my son will cope in a mainstream junior school. Having had two older children go through junior school i know how cruel children can sometimes be and i couldn't bear the thought of my son being left out and having no friends. Unfortunately the gap has widened and it is now noticeable. I feel my son would benefit from being in an enviroment where he doesn't feel different and where he can make friends and excel. Every child with special needs is different though and you have to trust your instincts about what is best for your son. I am lucky that i have had a positive experience with mainstream but i just feel for my son the time is right to move him. Maybe visit a special needs school and a few other mainstream junior school before you make a decision.

The staff were fantastic too but obviously we had a few problems with some parents saying he shouldn't be there. ""	""Our problems came when he moved to secondary school he went to mainstream. He started to fall behind and as the other children matured they started to grow away from him. He did years 78 and 9. In that time he went from being a happy child who would try anything and had lots of friends to a child withdrawn unhappy and lonely. He wasn't going out at playtimes and lunchtimes he sat inside in his form room and he ate his lunch away from everyone else too. It even got to the point where my mum had to pick him up at 2""	00 everyday as they didn't have anyone to support him. ""Throughout that 3 years from the time he first showed signs of being unhappy my mum fought to get him into our local special school. He eventually joined special school in year 10. The change was incredible within a few months. After 4 weeks he was eating in the school hall after 6 weeks he was going outside at playtimes and lunchtimes. The Christmas after he started in the September he was in his first school concert he was so happy and confident back to the boy he used to be. Myself and my parents and our 6 other siblings were in the audience all with tears streaming down our faces even our 3 brothers who were at the time aged 29 22 and 21.

Around third grade everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes. There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school. I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents. We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b/c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument.

FALSE,As a teacher and parent I feel it isn’t black and white but completely depends on the child. I don’t necessarily agree with holding a child back for an athletic advantage. I do see holding them back if they are not socially and academically ready. I can usually pick out the September- November babies within the first week of school and I teach fourth grade. If you decide to put your children through and they are socially immature they will catch up eventually. Once you enter the workforce you are surrounded by people of all ages and it no longer matters. I think either way is ok whatever works best for the parents and children. 	
FALSE,"I have four kids a girl 15 a boy 12 a boy 11 and a girl 10. I held the boys back but not the girls.

If he was in his own grade he would be the shortest in the class by A Lot. Now he is in the lower middle. He doesn’t play sports he is more of an artist/musician so I didn’t do it for any competitive advantage. That being said I shouldn’t have held him back because he is more EMOTIONALLY mature than his peers. I didn’t want him to be bullied or picked on for his short stature but now because he is more mature than his peers he doesn’t have as many friends in his grade.

So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade. """
TRUE,I think it all depends on the childs individual development and personality. I am having the opposite with my youngest he misses the cut of by 9days but I know will be ready. He will be 3 in July and will be going into the pre-school class at day care then because he is physically emotionally and intelectually up to this level. So I am currently trying to get him assessed by the state board of education to enter pre-prep (kindergarten in USA) at school for next year. However with my oldest if he were born a couple of months earlier I would have kept him back a year as he would not have been ready.
TRUE,"Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature. It doesn't matter what the cut-off date is there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not. You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics. 	""If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th. She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically. If she was down one grade it wouldn't make much difference socially since she is SO far off but she would be further ahead with academics totally bored and would have other issues there as a result. I don't necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school. """
TRUE,"If a young five is already reading and doing basic math they can continue to develop those skills at home for another year. That's what we are doing. She may be advanced academically but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that maturity-wise. The school is having her wait and I am 100% fine with that. 	""She can keep doing her thing at home another year and do half day preschool. They will find ways to challenge her the curriculum is designed to accomodate all skill levels. """
TRUE,"I think there will be a backlash about this.	""I have a child who I sent to KG at age 4 our cutoffs are December 1.

TRUE,Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise. Parents should be able to keep their kids home an extra year if they believe their child isn't ready for the classroom environment but when they enroll they should be put into the 1st grade (again unless there is a documented delay).

TRUE,"I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten. DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS. He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it. He was very good at sports though even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team. 	I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4.

""I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone.

FALSE,"I'm not really trying to justify my decision with how my DH felt about starting school at 4. I was just giving his point of view. Most adults I know who started school at age 4 did not like being younger than their peers. Granted here in the midwest most kids start school at a solid 5 years old and many turn 6 in KG.

TRUE,Otherwise it doesn't make sense. Regardless of when they start school they will be edcuated for 13 years of their lives. Why do parents feel the need to push other parents to start their children younger? 	Redshirting isn't just about your individual kid. Studies show the practice (when common) has socioeconomic repurcissions down the line and can increase the HS drop out rate for lower-income kids who were not themselves redshirted as well as other disadvangates economically for society. I posted a study a few pages back. There are lots of similar findings.
FALSE,Different regions are different I realize but here they obviously feel the same way because the cut-off is now July 1st. Which means the child has to turn 5 by July 1st or they cannot start KG yet. So DS is starting right ON TIME. 	yeah but if that's the rule there then you are not redshirting. You are going with the guidelines. So this is not about you. Here the cut off is October and yet quite a few kids with birthdays in July through September are held back. THAT is redshirting.
TRUE,"You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids. Every once in a while a child might stand out but it's not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem ""older"" or ""younger"" 	I don't necessarily disagree with you. So the question isWhy do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go? If you really can't tell - why don't you just follow the rules? ""FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first. But being at the tail end of this you can't tell after that. Every single solitary teacher I've spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade. I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated. The teacher says she can't tell any difference at all. """

BTW - her """"issues"""" affected her fluency not her ability to learn. That's just my personal experience.

FALSE,"So if this is really the case ... if when to start school is for the best intereset of the child then why can't people start their kids EARLY?! Why do so many schools make it near impossible to skip a year? But if you want to hold your kid back you just do it.? 	Because that is a case of funding and is out of the hands of the parent. States only provide funding for children who meet the age minimum. There are also many states and/or school districts that allow children to test in early. 	""Perhaps it is regional but why is it so many think that kindergarten is the only academically acceptable alternative to preK? Don't parents research what is available to them?

FALSE,"Karen - in our District you can start early. They test you in.

FALSE,Disposable kids are the best. I take one on every away mission.	
TRUE,The problem is that you are only looking at 5 and 6 year olds. I teach middle school and see a HUGE difference in abilities between the younger and older kids. The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues. The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels. There have been a lot of studies that show people born later in the year (March) are more successful in life due to the age gap. My In our state we have one of the youngest start ages (5 by Dec 31st). My daughter was born on the cut off date. I held her back.
TRUE,"In this state the school has little say over who can be held back; it is entirely up to the parents. A good many of our kindergarteners show up without the behaviors that will allow them to succeed and with the behaviors which make it hard to teach others. You don't need to write books about something that takes the average teacher about 30 seconds to realize. When you advance your child despite indications that you should not you push social development before cognitive development which many experts now hold as interdependent. That means your child may not have the skills to be successful at grade level. And contrary to the old saying it will not work out in the wash. It does not help that the average adult here functions with what amounts to an eighth grade education. Mostly we end up with middle school aged children who are reading at third or fourth grade level rendering grade appropriate textbooks and reading material useless. If you really really care about your child take an interest in them early. Read to them and encourage them to at least become familiar with letters and counting. DO NOT PLOP THEM IN FRONT OF A TV SCREEN and leave them unattended. Talk about what you watched. Those of you who will not accept responsibility for your parenting (or lack thereof) those of you who switch schools every half year because your child ""doesn't fit in"" and those of you who hold the school responsible for fixing YOUR mistakes are the cancer that is killing American education."
TRUE,"Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade.  	This is just plain wrong. CNN should not publish such nonsense.	I have studied how children learn and develop and have been in the field of early care and education for more than 30 years.

FALSE,I have noticed that educators seem to take my decision to homeschool very personally. It's strange. 	I noticed this too.

TRUE,My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off. He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well considering he is the youngest in the class. Last year his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year. Pre-K was only 3 hours long while Kindergarten was a full day. My husband and I agreed that if our son has to be held back it will be when we're sure he's not keeping up with the kids and Pre-K is not that time. He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged. He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten. I'm happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision.
TRUE,"this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid... perhaps for some parents there's some truth to it. when i was a kid back in the dark ages there wasn't day care pre-school 4 year old kindergarten we didn't have all these things kids can do via the rec. dept. on the cheap the dance classes soccer softball on and on ad nauseum. when i was a kid i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten. there wasn't even the designation of 5K; there was just KINDERGARTEN. your kid turned 5 you sent them to KINDERGARTEN boom done. if you had to do something and be child free during that time the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block. now parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up get them ahead of their peers send them to umpteen different activities get them in pre-school and now this redshirting thing. too often parents are doing it because it's the done thing now not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child; someone said it was a good idea so they did it. we didn't put our daughter in day care pre-school or 4K; ppl thought we were nuts. she was allowed to ""just be a kid"" until she started school at 5 and for every one of the last 4 years she has continued to ""just be a kid"". she is academically ahead of the curve she is a social butterfly (which she did NOT get from her wallflower mother) she didn't suffer for me deciding that i was very capable tyvm of teaching her myself and that ""socializing"" at the park and the play areas at the mall was fine for learning how to interact with her peers. she takes one dance class 45 minutes every saturday because she asked if she could not because i think it's good for much of anything; she likes to dance and maybe she'll learn to not be such a clod. all this pressure i see on other kids and where's the benefit? what DO you do if you hold them back that first year? i am in the somewhat these days enviable position of being a stay at home mom and i am a nerdy book worm so it's easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education and in such a way that she doesn't think she's being taught ha ha sneaky mom. how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs? the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school because they both work and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school? i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting and yes i have looked because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same. but no i don't see it. if you want your kid to just be a kid DON'T put them in all these activities unless they ASK to do them. there's no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college or if you won't or can't teach them on your own. there's no social advantage at all; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school! these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time maybe i can see it IF these kids are doing something to help them in w/e area they are lacking but to do it for sports or just because they need that one extra year to ""just be a kid""? no."
FALSE,I am a mother of four my oldest is 21 and the youngest is 10. I have seen a huge shift in people holding kids back. I truly think it is dependent on your child.

Listen to your pre school teacher and trust your gut.
TRUE,In our case my daughter is born 1 day before cutoff date (8/30) making her the youngest in the class. She went to preschool for 2 years and had lot of social issues and anxiety issues. We were in the best school district and she was going to a very good school which my son attended too. We changed her to couple of other schools thinking it is with the school. She used to come home with complaints and never ever speaking in the class. She was academically doing good as per other kids but clearly lagging behind in other areas. Seeing her anxiety issues my pediatrician begged me to hold her back. It was very hard as a parent to make the decision but we held her back after careful consideration. In the long run I want my kid to be happy and confident. Since the school began (3 months)  she adjusted so well in the new school and all her anxiety and social issues were gone. She is happy made so many friends and speaking up in the class. She is extremely social and zero complaints. I am thankful to my pediatrician for bringing this up. We are glad we made this decision and held her back because i don't want her to carry these issues all her life. Finally I am not against or for for holding back but it depends on each kids case.
FALSE,"Due to the alignment of our school system my 9th grade year was spent in a junior high where I was averaging a 1.6-1.7 GPA and tested a grade or two or three (depending on the subject–I've always been horrible at maths) below my level in every subject. There was talk about holding me back a year. 	""Well guess what? The next year I went on to 10th grade and to a high school environment where I earned a 3.2 my first semester and 3.1 my second semester. Why the turn-around?

I also went from being in a school with a few hundred students to nearly 4000 which saved me from the severe bullying that I'd experienced; the anonymity coupled with the rush to get to class through the crowded hallways put bullying on the back burner for the majority of students.

TRUE,I decided when my middle child was pushed to skip thru school to hold him back. He didn't want to skip and didn't posses the required social skills. Each child is different I had to find other outlets for his intelect but it was very important that this undersized uncoordinated boy learn the proper social skills before he was pushed into higher grades. He was 6 years old when he started 1st grade. The school only stopped trying to skip him to an older grade when in 8th grade they introduced excellerated classes. These worked out very well he was able to compete with older boys in the math/sciences but stay with his grade for english/history and recess.
TRUE,Our daughter barely made the age cut-off for kindergarten (late summer birthday) but against our better judgement we started her anyway. A couple years later she continued to struggle behind her classmates. She is repeating 3rd grade this year and is having a much better time of it not just academically but also socially. The school was reluctant to retain her and told us this was rarely done but we know this was the best decision we ever could have made. She will still only be 18 when she graduates from high school.
FALSE,One size does not fit ALL. Take an interest dont guess what is best KNOW	
TRUE,We kept our middle child back one year. She turned 5 in early September but our thought was emotionally she wasn't ready so she started at 6. We always did a lot of reading and exploring the world we live in so keeping her mind busy wasn't a problem. She is now a lawyer who graduated in 2011 president of the law school bar association hired right out of school and doing very well. What struck me throughout her school years was her total confidence as she went through school. She always felt she could succeed and did.

The older peer students do better and struggle less in school. There are no good answers as long as we hold on to the production line model of education. If parents would step up and demand schools be child centered we could make a difference. In a child centered program all students are on individualized tracks. We would have to get rid of traditional A B C D E grading and move to a mastery based program. The problem with this isfar too many parents and politicians want us to reach 21st century goals with early 20th century methods.
TRUE,"It's not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it's better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled. It's an opinion. I have reasons behind it. And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward just that the overall ""School"" experience to me is very important for development of all children and to me that can't be entirely replicated at home. Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids religion wanting to keep control on kids special snowflake syndrome etc? Yes I do. I'm sorry but I do. Do I judge all families that choose to homeschool based on that? No way. Especially not here where there are a lot of highly intelligent people who break the mold IMO for ""Every day"" mothers in lots of ways. But in general I don't think I could ever be convinced that it's ""wrong"" for me to be anti-homeschool. Honestly there are likely a lot more people that feel the way I do it's just not something popular to speak out about here. 	"
TRUE,"My older son entered public kindergarten this year at the age of 5-1/2. He is enjoys school and his friends.

FALSE,My son has a late September birthday. Our school district's cut-off date for entering Kindergarten is September 30. If he had started Kindergarten when he could have he would have been 4 years old the entire first six weeks of school.

He still has trouble making friends and navigating social situations. And he still has trouble separating at the beginning of the school day (or transitioning in general).

FALSE,Is it odd that I still keep my 3yo out of preschool and straight to kindergarten when they turn 4? Is preschool homeschooling even a thing?
FALSE,It sounds like he is ready to me! The cut off date here is September 30. My son has an August birthday and school starts at the end of July so he turned 5 in Kindergarten. He is now thriving in 3rd grade and doing better than one of his redshirted classmates. He would’ve been so bored with an extra year of preschool. My eldest girl is a January baby and will start Kindergarten this year. My youngest girl is only two and has a mid-September birthday. We’re moving this summer and I don’t know what the cutoff is in our new district but I’m hoping that it’s the same and she’ll be ready at almost five. I worry she’ll be bored too plus it will be nice to stop paying $800 per month for daycare.

TRUE,He sounds ready. What IS the cut-off date? Ours is Sept. 30th and no one ”red shirts”. There is about 5 cases a year for the whole province of Quebec mostly very immature children. Three of my girls were born in August but there is no question of holding them back. Everybody in my family (my siblings husband’s sibling)skipped a year in school i.e. moved forward faster.
TRUE,My daughter will be 5 in Sept. and she is going to Kindergarten. She is very excited to go and I don’t want her to be behind. She can write her on name and knows some of her Abc’s but not all of them. She is small for age but so was I. I was probably one if the smallest kids in my class my entire life but my mom did not hold me back and I am glad. I had some issues when I was younger with a learning disability but I learned to cope. I had a lot of friends and even skipped a year of high school.
TRUE,I think you really have to know your own child. He sounds like he’s mostly ready but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class. I know my oldest was and it’s just now in the fourth grade that he’s really catching up to his peers. He wasn’t ready for kindergarten though. You son sounds like he’s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise. 	With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he’s six. It’s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is.

Here is my experience and I hope it will help you with your decision""In preschool I had some issues just like your son. Yes I knew my ABCs since 2 just like him. I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers (not to brag but you know what I mean). However I was behind socially; I couldn’t stand up for myself without swearing (actually using the f-word and such) I refused to ask for help so I was redshirted. Now I am extremely confident and star in theatre performances school choir am going to take ABRSM Grade 7 for Piano perfected the AMC 8 and am taking Pre-Calculus.

I feel socially confident now and feel great (except when I got 91.5/150 on AMC 10 and 76.5/150 on AMC 12- I have extremely high standards for myself). Being at the top of the class is awesome. 	""Anyways I think you should “redshirt” your son but to compensate for him being the eldest child in his class you should try to get him to excel in something.

FALSE,I think it's ridiculous to be up in arms over a homeschooled student switching to PS or using some PS programs when PS take all of the tax money regardless of whether the student is in school at all. If anything people who homeschool send their kids to private school or just never have kids at all are actually helping the schools by pumping in more money without adding in more kids.

FALSE,he was playing football at his local public school but then moved into an apartment to attend a different highschool. 	That is a completely different situation then. There are PS families who do this sort of thing over sports as well. 	
FALSE,It's not a matter of lying it's a matter of being able to do something like not actually homeschooling during football season since you have the rest of the year to get the studying in.

A hundred dollar bill is not a public service.	""A better analogy would be something like a city fire department. Suppose I live in a neighborhood which has been recently annexed by a city.

(Much of the department's funding is via local property taxes but there is supplementation from the state.)

FALSE,"Just to be clear there are a couple million funding allocations so it's petty bewildering.

My neighbors that have been forced to put their child in private school this year do the same most all of the homeschoolers that I know do the same. I'm involved within my community helping to support our public schools. I plan to volunteer at the elementary school once DD is a bit older.

FALSE,What a great story about the power of self-motivated education! Clearly the lesson to be drawn is that the reporting exemption for religious reasons is silly.

Frankly the difference is in the parenting and input not in the method of education. And the same goes for any child in any school as any teacher will tell you. The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support. At school or homeschooled.

If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up and work with the parent then the kid will do well and work through difficulties. Sadly many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter not something to be worked with and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child. You really can't expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed when their parents can't be bothered to pick them up after a football match or send them to school dirty unwashed. Or leave it to the teacher (me) to pick the kid up from a supermarket for shoplifting and sort it out because they are watching the football. All this and more happened to me.

TRUE,"I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters. I once read admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication that a child if properly taught can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school. The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art playing etc. 	""If done by parents with the right mindset education levels and resources I cannot see the problem. ""	""OTOH one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline (school tries to parents object) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns. In those cases children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it.

TRUE,Not necessarily so Doomz.	As a kid I went to the village CofE school with a hundred or so other little WASPS. I loathed virtually every one of them too and would have had a much less stressful childhood if I had been home schooled.* 	*Except for the whole step-mother thing.	
TRUE,"Oh come on. Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance. No one is claiming ""the professionals"" are the only ones who can teach. I wish. 	""What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents teachers notice and they report it. So some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught. ""	""If no one is checking up no one has noticed their child's bruises and withdrawal and misery. And so children die. It is not a widespread problem no one is claiming that. It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people.

FALSE,"seasonticket""	""Which all sound very reasonable except that the report in question provides absolutely no evidence that this is the case or that homeschooled pupils are any more likely to be abused.

Perhaps they should be forcing parents of non-homeschooled to submit to intrusive checks. 	"
TRUE,This authoratarian mob is scared stiff of any aspect of behaviour that they cannot control and record hence their proposals to make life ever more difficult in numerous tedious ways. Those who choose to educate their children at home are deemed especially dangerous in that their children they may actually learn things but even worse gain an intelligent and critical psyche horror of horrors they may even start asking awkward questions about governance and democracy in their maturity. 	
FALSE,This is code for they want to check that your child is not being taught unsuitable material and by that I mean your own morals and political opinions. When a child is being home schooled the government has no access to that childs mind. The government are afraid of having a generation of people with 'free thinking' that have not received state control codes. 	
TRUE,More likely to be filled with bigoted nonsense that makes them unfit for normal life. Most homeschoolers I have met have done so for religious or political reasons they have not been that bright themselves and they have simply indoctrinated their children without outside influence. In fact you're talking bollocks it's the complete reverse. 	
TRUE,"@ Danot ""There's a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus. It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family."" 	""You don't nee"
TRUE,"The issue with home schooling is that while it might be an alternative option for those parents attentive enough to care about the development of their child and have the will for them to reach their full potential it is also an available option for those parents whose input into their child's life is simply that they bred. 	""What of those children whose parents couldn't care less about their child or whose child plays truant? Can they not then choose to 'home educate'? ""	""While many home educators are very supportive of their children taking them to clubs etc where their child can socialise (read more on parentcentre.gov.uk)there are also children who are entirely unaccounted for as they have never been to school and are therefore not known by any local authority (especially if they move a lot). What of their education? ""	""Additionally home educators in my research appear to believe that they have the best means to educate their child ignoring all the professional qualifications checks and standards that have been worked at over the years. Not perfect no but better than unchecked parents teaching or guiding as some like to put it in any way they please. Not all parents are the same not all parents are equipped to help their children grow but all of them can choose to home educate. ""	""The other thing to remember is that your child has to one day enter into a society where there are many different cultures ideas lifestyles etc that they would come into contact with if they went to a state school. If they are either only getting your perspective on life or socialising in one demographic of society then that's surely not as good for them as sending them to state school?

TRUE,what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly.. I'm sure you are but there are plenty that aren't. Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it... an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it. 	
FALSE,"This is the only really objectionable part (if reported accurately) - providing a power to investigate purely on the basis of home schooling without any other evidence. 	""Otherwise I can't really see a problem about making sure that a homeschooling parent has sufficient ability to deliver adequate education to their child. Doing so on an annual basis is perfectly fair as for most parents there will come a point at which their own knowledge of a subject will be too low to enable them to do so adequately. General education and being a couple of chapters ahead might be OK for younger children but is probably not going to be enough for those in their mid-teens.

TRUE,"I'm not a fan of the nanny state but I can see why the government is doing this. The trouble is home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff.

His mum doesn't send him to school because she worries he'll get bullied. Actually he's much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely.

FALSE,"I was wondering when someone would mention Eunice Spry who was a foster carer (lots of checks for that) whose children were abused while they were at school (isn't that meant to be the ultimate safety-net?) and who welcomed home inspections.

The DCSF choose to keep calling what they're after 'registration' to generate precisely your reaction but that's because they're fundamentally dishonest scum. ""	"
TRUE,"I don't want to be the hate figure here but home schooling is probably always going to be the subject of some suspicion purely because any possible abuse wouldn't be able to be reported by any other pupils or teachers. And yeah I agree that people shouldn't be automatically deisgnated as suspects for child abuse simply because they decide on home teaching. 	However...	""Removal of a child from established programs and situations (such as state education) will always raise a question mark in these times. Of course turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark but generally these things mean nothing in isolation (an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark but you'll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it). ""	""And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won't be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children there will be someone somewhere who does and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur. It's a crappy situation and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case because they're not even walking a thin line anymore they're trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care. ""	""So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur (the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority) and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day a determined abuser will wait till the last minute. It's a hugely complicated situation that balances child protection and the assumption that a child's parents are the best source of protection for them (the current default position for child care). ""	""Frankly I doubt that any real answer will be found on this thread. Although Im pretty sure someone will scream about how dare I assume they're abusive etc... But you either have some checking of child welfare or none. ""	I've obviously not got the answers!"
TRUE,"Home schooling of chidren is in my opinion a form of abuse.	Children need to learn general social skills and not be locked into the mindset of their parents.
